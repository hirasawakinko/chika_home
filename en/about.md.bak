## Name

Chikadd

## Age

Within the general age of university student.

## Language

Chika knows Chinese, Japanese, and English very well.

## Education

Graduated from one of the top-tier university in Japan. Majored in Human Geography, interested in Gepgraphy Information Science. Chika's bachelor thesis is about urban morphology of Japan and limitations of map representation. Chika never skipped a lecture and the GPA is so high that everyone doubted that Chika is a studying abroad.

Chika also has a broad interest across almost all disciplines. From literature to philosophy, psychology to neuroscience, geography to geology, oceanology to meteorology, zoology to microbiology, astronomy to quantum-field-theory, classical computer science to quantum computing, pure mathematics to applied mathematics, Chika would like to know all of them. However time is limited, also gaining more scientific knowledge and is able to think more logically, Chika chose to abandon the not-so-important parts such as literature, philosophy, psychology, disciplines that are no where science and some how self-contradicting internally. Don't ever think to argue with this. Chika had never lost a battle.
