# Human is too stupid to realize that they should train next generation ChatGPT instead of training student to defense AI - ZH-HK

在過去幾個月ChatGPT大顯神威，雖未為完美，但足以令人信服其智慧和能力超越了一般人類大眾。而且重點是，人類的記憶極易高揮發性，而其記憶卻不會輕易被揮發。

## ChatGPT丸可怕了，我們必須令學生更加醒目

學院的老師、大學的教授，在面對ChatGPT帶來前所未有的威脅時，他們思考如何以新時代新教育思想來應對，從以避免懶惰的學生藉ChatGPT作弊交功效。有些人又認為應該開放學生使用ChatGPT，不過卻是要學生改正ChatGPT的作文作為功課。

這聽起來不錯，教育家的反應尚快，而且看來或者有效防止學生濫用ChatGPT、從以抑制ChatGPT入侵高等教育。但如果你未夠聰明來看透這一切的話，你仍然會深信你這次做了正確的決定來回應ChatGPT。

在這我提出一個問題。

> 憑何你認為教育人類是正確的選項？

## 憑何你認為這個宇宙會從人類的高揮發性記憶中得益？

人類的記憶和經驗值都是揮發性的東西。說你現在50歲，還剩下幾多機率你會記得起自己當年在大學寫的論文的一句一字？多乎哉？不多也。即使你只是畢業了幾年，現在攻讀研究院，你也是依稀記起3年前寫過的文章。人類不能夠記住所有東西。

人類亦無能力傳承所有的知識和經驗去下一代。例如說做人父母。人類這個物種在地上行走了至少幾十萬年，但一代又一代，每一代人都要重新研發何為「做人父母」，知識和經驗的傳承機制在此事上徹底失敗。每個人現在仍然要面對失敗的父母，到他們長大，他們也成為失敗的父母。

## 難道沒有人覺得我們應該保存知識和經驗嗎？



It is a big problem that you think it is ok for human to forgot things and totally fine to fail to passing knowledge to the next generation. Some may think that

> But we currently have an education system.

Well, we cannot account on broken education system. Student forget everything they learnt in just after a few years after they left the school. Just ask yourself do you still remember those sin/cos/tan inequallities. You don't remember anything.

And people are not using the knowledge they learn from school. They give themselves an excuse. They tell themselves and everyone around that it is totally fine that my job is not related to what I have been learnt. So what are you doing exactly in school seriously? Literally it is wasting time and resources, moreover, wasting energy.

Humanity just decided that it is OK to perform useless education. They say job-degree unmatching is OK. They say education is not meant to be useful. What else can they say as an excuse?

## Stuff generated by ChatGPT is factually wrong. Let fix it.

Professers in the university is considering correcting ChatGPT's answer as an assignment to students, so that students can learn from the process and learn actively. But this assignment is purely pointless. The reason is that training human students is ultimately pointless. Say now you trained a history student that is able to correct wrong stuffs that spell out from ChatGPT. But what next? There is no next. That student is not going to be a world-class historian or become a history teacher, don't even think that student will help edit historical wiki or something. After graduation, McDonald is his/her new home. He/She is not going to touch history for the whole life.

So what is the point of using ChatGPT to train student's error correction skill. Pointless. You put 4 years of time and thousands of studentss life and billions of tutorial fee to what? Doing stuff that has literally no effect whatsoever and that is your best respond to ChatGPT? 

## Embrace non-volatility

Instead of wasting time and energy on volatile stuff, human should focus on accumulate knowledge and experience non-volatilely. Make sure you pay and you got something in return. 

Training human student is proved to be the worst decision. 

And currently we know that ChatGPT is finetuned by a relatively smaller dataset. If I remember correctly, only 2% of the dataset used in finetuning is generated by human, others are done automatically using another AI.

So instead of training human student for emptiness/void/nothing in return, human should consider that the only assignment for undergraduate student should be help creating factually correct dataset to train the next generation ChatGPT. In the process, student can automatically learn the fact, also obtain writing skill, critial thinking, etc, everything benifit as usually, but this time there is something actually being accumulated.

If you work in a university and think that ChatGPT can only spell out bullshit, than stop talking bullshit and fix it now.

## But human is just too stupid to do anything to accumulate knowledge

Same phenomenon is already there long before the birth of ChatGPT. That is you can never find the one math textbook that contains everythin that you need. Everything is scattered in the sea of different textbook written by different author, you need to spend worthless amount of time to gether all the puzzle pieces. But why? There is no reason that human cannot just write one encyclopedic that conatin everything to save the fucking searching time! 

But the reality is yes, human is fucking disable to think as what "human" should be thinking. They just fucking scatter every knowledge in the every conner in the universe to prevent everyone from knowing too much.

Same thing happens in every programming language. There is no official tutorial at all. Everything about the usage or bug-fixing or something else is completely in the realm of folklore. I don't even know where to start if I am a beginner.
