What if we add first then multiply in matrix multiplication?


Inner Product in linear algebra is defined as the following:

    vector a = [a1]
               [a2]
               [a3]
    
    vector b = [b1]
               [b2]
               [b3]
               
    inner product(a, b)
    = a1 b1 + a2 b2 + a3 b3
    = sum[i]( ai * bi )
    
What if I swap the addition and multiplication? What will happen?

       sum[i]( ai * bi )
    -> mul[i]( ai + bi )
    
    => (a1 + b1) (a2 + b2) (a3 + b3)
    
Let's expend this equation.

    (a1 + b1) (a2 + b2) (a3 + b3)
    
    = a1 (a2 + b2) (a3 + b3) 
    + b1 (a2 + b2) (a3 + b3)
    
    = a1 a2 (a3 + b3) 
    + a1 b2 (a3 + b3)
    + b1 a2 (a3 + b3)
    + b1 b2 (a3 + b3)

    = a1 a2 a3
    + a1 a2 b3
    + a1 b2 a3
    + a1 b2 b3
    + b1 a2 a3
    + b1 a2 b3
    + b1 b2 a3
    + b1 b2 b3
    
    
This result is showing that every possibly route to go down the vector.

    e.g. a1 a2 a3

    [a1] [b1]
      |
    [a2] [b2]
      |
    [a3] [b3]
    
    e.g. a1 a2 b3

    [a1] [b1]
      |
    [a2] [b2]
        \
    [a3] [b3]
    
But what means by multiplying all possibly route and then add them up?

The only sense I can make out of it that this arithematic is probabily dealing with "probability".

Say there are 3 electron orbits. The probability that you will find an electron in there can be expressed by system c. And there is another 3 electron orbits expressed by system d.

    system c = [0.4]
               [0.2]
               [0.2]
    
    system d = [0.3]
               [0.5]
               [0.2]

And magically system c and system d collides and they now sharing the same 3 orbits spacially. But still they are independent systems, just overlaping their orbits.

    c      d
    [0.4]  [0.3]  orbit1
    [0.2]  [0.5]  orbit2
    [0.2]  [0.2]  orbit3
    
Now 3 electrons filled all 3 orbits. 

One electron is in orbit1 but it is contributed by system c, and the chance to find an electron in system c orbit1 is 0.4. 

Another electron is in orbit2 but it is contributed by system d, and the chance to find an electron in system d orbit2 is 0.5. 
    
Another electron is in orbit3 but it is contributed by system c, and the chance to find an electron in system c orbit3 is 0.2. 

So the overall probability is 0.4 * 0.5 * 0.2.

As ultimately there are 3 electrons there. There is a lot of different combination of the source of contributions. So you add up all those probilities.

    = a1 a2 a3
    + a1 a2 b3
    + a1 b2 a3
    + a1 b2 b3
    + b1 a2 a3
    + b1 a2 b3
    + b1 b2 a3
    + b1 b2 b3
    
    = arbitrary real number
    
But then the result is a number. What is the meaning of this number? The total probility that I will find 3 electrons in such compond system? My real question is, what is this number means by a matrix operation?

    # .x. to label the multiplication part
    
    [.system m.]  [.v1.]  = [.z1.] <= what is this shit?
    [ system n ]  [.v2.]    [ z2 ]
    [ system o ]  [.v3.]    [ z3 ]

The meaning of vector v has changed and vector z now has totally different meaning.

Can I say that z1 z2 z3 now means the probabilities that I will find 3 electrons in system m n o respectively? 
    
Than I multiply another set systems (matrix) on to it, to obtain a further compounded complex system? 

    system m n o interacting with system v w x
    
    [.system m.]  [.v1.| w1 | x1 ]  = [.z1.| p1 | q1 ] 
    [ system n ]  [.v2.| w2 | x2 ]    [ z2 | p2 | q2 ]
    [ system o ]  [.v3.| w3 | x3 ]    [ z3 | p3 | q3 ]
