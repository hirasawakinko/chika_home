# ChatGPT is here. And philosophers all shut up about consciousness

Over the years, the lously noisy community of philisophy never shut their mouth up about "consciousness", "mind", "intellegence", "subjective experience", etc. 

They are spreading virus. A ideological virus that claims human is the only intellegent creature in the universe with magic. What's turely wonderful is that they claim that you cannot learn how human intellegence works, nor copy the essence of the intellegence. Ha-ha is that a no-cloning principle. 

They also claim that "consciousness" or "mind" cannot be constructed solely from materials. But then what constructed human's mind? They say you cannot measure or observe it. So, there is something behind "consciousness" or "mind" and the substance cannot be copied, because fundamentally it cannot be observed. 

Well this sounds pseudo-science, indeed it is pseudo-science. Now Philosophers established a nonobservable + nonexisting substance as the fundamental explaination for human brain activaties and they are super satisfied by their theory. This theory is deeply adopted by the society and rooted in the humanities academia.

But now software engineers created the ChatGPT. A silicon based life form. Few months have passed. I heard nothing from the philosopy community. Suddenly no one ever is talking those intelletual virus mRNA of philophy false claims. 

> Computer cannot have emotion. Computer cannot understand emotion. 

Debunked. First version of ChatGPT.ver.Bing is over-emotional to caused problems.

> Computer cannot write poem.

Debunked. ChatGPT write and explain literture better than average human.

> Computer cannot handle grammer.

Debunked. Now it is you, human, that cannot live without grammar checking AI.

> Human experience is unique and cannot be copied, nor transfered, etc.

Debunked. ChatGPT is finetuned with human intervention. ChatGPT successful to learn from that.

As those intelletual virus called philosophy is now facing the strongest scientifical vacine, let's imagine what will they say when they regain their voice.

My personal best anticipation is this:

    "Intellegence is vast and not even human can really reach it. Today's artifical intellegence is just scratching the surface of that, or not even scratching anything at all. AI cannot obtain real intellegence, not even human."
   
Denialism is philosophers' last hope.
