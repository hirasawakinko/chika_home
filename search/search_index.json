But let say one interval is (1,1e18), then you must make a 1e18-long list to do the task. This doesn't sound efficient. Therefore in order to implement this algorithm efficiently, you have to work directly with intervals. Data Structure \u00b6 I choose list for the sake of simplicity. Since the intervals are just number pairs, you can encode them in a list. Text Only 1 2 3 [ (a b) (c d) ] Here you have a list length=4, contains number of intervals=2 Therefore you can make use of the property of a plain list, you can do binary search, also slicing on it. For example: Text Only 1 2 3 A = [ (1 4) (7 9) ] next interval = (3, 6) = (lo, hi) Lets consider 3=lo. We need know where should 3 belongs to A, namely, is 3 within some interval or outside of any interval. Here you use binary search to find the point of insert. Python 1 2 3 >>> from bisect import bisect as find >>> insert_point = find ( A , 3 ) 1 This is a odd number. odd number means it is within the interval at index 0~1. Because: Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 intervals = [ (a b) (c d) ... ] index = [ 0 1 2 3 ... ] index is odd even odd even... odd insert index ==means==> after a even index ==means==> (start, insert, end) Thus by finding whether the index returned by find() is even or edd. You also know whether it is being inserted within or outside a particular interval. That is: Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 A = [ (1 4) (7 9) ] next = (3 6) for 3: find(A, 3) => 1 => odd => within particaular interval for 6: find(A, 6) => 2 => even => outside of any interval As 3 is within particular interval, it is overlapped with that particular interval, thus is consecutive. Therefore you can combine them as one single interval. Text Only 1 new_A = [ (1 6) (7,9) ] This is the basic idea of this algorithm. Here is the implementation. Divide and Conquer \u00b6 But there is more to think about. What about boundary case? How is that exactly to combine intervals and update the list? First of all, let's break things down into smaller parts. Consider the same list as previous section, Text Only 1 2 3 4 A = [ (1 4) (7 9) ] # For arbitrary interval next interval = (lo, hi) combine intervals and update the list \u00b6 Before going into the details of handling lo and hi, first you need to know how to do the finishing task. Let say this is the result. (1, 4) combine with (lo, hi), to form a new (1, hi) interval, replacing the old one. Text Only 1 2 3 4 A = [ (1 4) (7 9) ] next = (lo hi) new_A = [ (1 hi) (7 9) ] In general case, there you can divide the list into three parts: Text Only 1 2 3 [ <left intervals> <combined intervals> <righ intervals> ] [ <left intervals> ( 1 lo 4 hi ) <righ intervals> ] What you need to do is to split the list into three parts, replace the middle part with combined intervals, and then put these three parts back together as the new list. In order to achive this, you have to find out the lower and upper limits for slicing. For example, for a completely disjointed new interval: Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 from bisect import bisect as find A = [ 1 , 4 , 9 , 10 ] new_interval = [ 6 , 7 ] lo_limit = find ( A , 6 ) up_limit = find ( A , 7 ) new_A = A [: lo_limit ] + new_interval + A [ up_limit :] # new_A = A[:2] + new_interval + A[2:] This is only for the case of completely disjointed new interval. The others have different lower and uppper limits. However no matter which cases, the goal is in fact finding the slicing indices of the combined intervals. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 index = 0 1 1 2 2 3 #------------------------------ # [ (1, lo, 4, hi) (7 9) ] => A[0:2] = combined_intervals in case of lo \u00b6 First deal with lo. There are 3 location where lo is possibly being inserted. That is: Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 (1 4) ^ ^ ^ a b c a = left b = middle c = right case a: even lo <= 1 case b: odd 1 <= lo < 4 case c even 4 <= lo Nevertheless, you should ask whether each position indicates consecutiveness or not. Also, where should it be the new lowest point of the interval (lo, hi). Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 from bisect import bisect as find A = [ ( 1 4 ) ( 7 9 ) ] new = ( lo , hi ) i = find ( A , lo ) if i % 2 : # i is odd # case b # since lo is within the interval, # the lowest point is left boundary of that interval lowest = A [ i - 1 ] else : # i is even # case a # if lo==1, this is True. # if lo<1, this is also True. # if lo<1, it means that (1, 4) is inside (lo, hi), # so the lowest point is lo. if lo <= A [ i ]: lowest = lo # case c else : # A[i-1] < lo # disjoint if A [ i - 1 ] < lo : lowest = lo # connected else : lowest = A [ i - 2 ] boundary case \u00b6 What if lo is the smallest number and find(A, lo)==0 ?

But this assignment is purely pointless. The reason is that training human students is ultimately pointless. Say now you trained a history student that is able to correct wrong stuffs that spell out from ChatGPT. But what next? There is no next. That student is not going to be a world-class historian or become a history teacher, don't even think that student will help edit historical wiki or something. After graduation, McDonald is his/her new home. He/She is not going to touch history for the whole life. \u90a3\u4e48\u4f7f\u7528ChatGPT\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u6280\u80fd\u6709\u4f55\u610f\u4e49\u5462\uff1f\u6beb\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u4f60\u82b1\u8d39\u4e86\u56db\u5e74\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u6210\u5343\u4e0a\u4e07\u4e2a\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u751f\u547d\u548c\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u8d39\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8981\u505a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6beb\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\uff1f\u8fd9\u662f\u4f60\u5bf9ChatGPT\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u56de\u5e94\u5417\uff1f \u90a3\u4e48\u4f7f\u7528 ChatGPT \u57f9\u8bad\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u66f4\u6b63\u6280\u80fd\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u610f\u4e49\u5462\uff1f\u6beb\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u4f60\u82b1\u8d39\u4e86\u56db\u5e74\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u751f\u547d\u548c\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u7684\u6559\u7a0b\u8d39\u7528\uff0c\u505a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5b8c\u5168\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u6548\u679c\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4f60\u5bf9 ChatGPT \u7684\u6700\u597d\u56de\u5e94\u5417\uff1f So what is the point of using ChatGPT to train student's error correction skill.

If I remember correctly, only 2% of the dataset used in finetuning is generated by human, others are done automatically using another AI. \u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4eba\u985e\u4e0d\u61c9\u8a72\u8a13\u7df4\u5b78\u751f\u70ba\u4e86\u7a7a\u7121/\u865b\u7121\u800c\u5b78\u7fd2\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u61c9\u8a72\u8003\u616e\u5230\u672c\u79d1\u5b78\u751f\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\u61c9\u8a72\u662f\u5e6b\u52a9\u5275\u5efa\u4e8b\u5be6\u4e0a\u6b63\u78ba\u7684\u6578\u64da\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8a13\u7df4\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u7684ChatGPT\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b78\u751f\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u52d5\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e8b\u5be6\uff0c\u4e26\u7372\u5f97\u5beb\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u8003\u7b49\u7b49\uff0c\u7372\u76ca\u532a\u6dfa\uff0c\u4f46\u9019\u6b21\u5be6\u969b\u4e0a\u7d2f\u7a4d\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u6771\u897f\u3002 \u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4eba\u985e\u4e0d\u61c9\u8a72\u8a13\u7df4\u5b78\u751f\u53bb\u8ffd\u6c42\u7a7a\u865b\u3001\u865b\u7121\u6216\u6c92\u6709\u56de\u5831\u7684\u5883\u754c\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u61c9\u8a72\u8003\u616e\u5c07\u672c\u79d1\u5b78\u751f\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u4efb\u52d9\u8a2d\u5b9a\u70ba\u5e6b\u52a9\u5275\u5efa\u4e8b\u5be6\u6e96\u78ba\u7684\u6578\u64da\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u57f9\u990a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3ChatGPT\u3002\u5728\u9019\u500b\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b78\u751f\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u52d5\u5b78\u7fd2\u4e8b\u5be6\uff0c\u540c\u6642\u7372\u5f97\u5beb\u4f5c\u6280\u5de7\u3001\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u8003\u7b49\u7b49\u7684\u597d\u8655\uff0c\u4f46\u9019\u4e00\u6b21\u5be6\u969b\u4e0a\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u7a4d\u7d2f\u7684\u6771\u897f\u3002 \u5982\u679c\u4f60\u5728\u5927\u5b78\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u8a8d\u70baChatGPT\u53ea\u80fd\u8aaa\u51fa\u80e1\u8a00\u4e82\u8a9e\uff0c\u90a3\u9ebc\u5c31\u505c\u6b62\u8aaa\u80e1\u8a71\uff0c\u73fe\u5728\u5c31\u4fee\u6b63\u5b83\u3002 \u5982\u679c\u4f60\u5728\u5927\u5b78\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u8a8d\u70baChatGPT\u53ea\u6703\u80e1\u8aaa\u516b\u9053\uff0c\u90a3\u5c31\u5225\u518d\u8aaa\u5ee2\u8a71\u4e86\uff0c\u73fe\u5728\u5c31\u4f86\u89e3\u6c7a\u5b83\u3002 So instead of training human student for emptiness/void/nothing in return, human should consider that the only assignment for undergraduate student should be help creating factually correct dataset to train the next generation ChatGPT. In the process, student can automatically learn the fact, also obtain writing skill, critial thinking, etc, everything benifit as usually, but this time there is something actually being accumulated. If you work in a university and think that ChatGPT can only spell out bullshit, than stop talking bullshit and fix it now.

That is you can never find the one math textbook that contains everythin that you need. Everything is scattered in the sea of different textbook written by different author, you need to spend worthless amount of time to gether all the puzzle pieces. But why? There is no reason that human cannot just write one encyclopedic that conatin everything to save the fucking searching time! But the reality is yes, human is fucking disable to think as what \"human\" should be thinking. They just fucking scatter every knowledge in the every conner in the universe to prevent everyone from knowing too much. Same thing happens in every programming language. There is no official tutorial at all. Everything about the usage or bug-fixing or something else is completely in the realm of folklore. I don't even know where to start if I am a beginner.","title":"Human is too stupid to realize that they should train next generation ChatGPT instead of training student to defense\u00a0AI - ZH-HK"},{"location":"blog/Human%20is%20too%20stupid%20to%20realize%20that%20they%20should%20train%20next%20generation%20ChatGPT%20instead%20of%20training%20student%20to%20defense%C2%A0AI-zhhk/#human-is-too-stupid-to-realize-that-they-should-train-next-generation-chatgpt-instead-of-training-student-to-defense-ai-zh-hk","text":"\u5728\u904e\u53bb\u5e7e\u500b\u6708ChatGPT\u5927\u986f\u795e\u5a01\uff0c\u96d6\u672a\u70ba\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff0c\u4f46\u8db3\u4ee5\u4ee4\u4eba\u4fe1\u670d\u5176\u667a\u6167\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4e00\u822c\u4eba\u985e\u5927\u773e\u3002\u800c\u4e14\u91cd\u9ede\u662f\uff0c\u4eba\u985e\u7684\u8a18\u61b6\u6975\u6613\u9ad8\u63ee\u767c\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u8a18\u61b6\u537b\u4e0d\u6703\u8f15\u6613\u88ab\u63ee\u767c\u3002","title":"Human is too stupid to realize that they should train next generation ChatGPT instead of training student to defense\u00a0AI -

But this assignment is purely pointless. The reason is that training human students is ultimately pointless. Say now you trained a history student that is able to correct wrong stuffs that spell out from ChatGPT. But what next? There is no next. That student is not going to be a world-class historian or become a history teacher, don't even think that student will help edit historical wiki or something.

And people are not using the knowledge they learn from school. They give themselves an excuse. They tell themselves and everyone around that it is totally fine that my job is not related to what I have been learnt. So what are you doing exactly in school seriously? Literally it is wasting time and resources, moreover, wasting energy. Humanity just decided that it is OK to perform useless education. They say job-degree unmatching is OK. They say education is not meant to be useful. What else can they say as an excuse? Stuff generated by ChatGPT is factually wrong. Let fix it. \u00b6 Professers in the university is considering correcting ChatGPT's answer as an assignment to students, so that students can learn from the process and learn actively. But this assignment is purely pointless. The reason is that training human students is ultimately pointless. Say now you trained a history student that is able to correct wrong stuffs that spell out from ChatGPT. But what next? There is no next. That student is not going to be a world-class historian or become a history teacher, don't even think that student will help edit historical wiki or something. After graduation, McDonald is his/her new home. He/She is not going to touch history for the whole life. So what is the point of using ChatGPT to train student's error correction skill. Pointless.

What will happen? Text Only 1 2 3 4 sum[i]( ai * bi ) -> mul[i]( ai + bi ) => (a1 + b1) (a2 + b2) (a3 + b3) Let's expend this equation. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 (a1 + b1) (a2 + b2) (a3 + b3) = a1 (a2 + b2) (a3 + b3) + b1 (a2 + b2) (a3 + b3) = a1 a2 (a3 + b3) + a1 b2 (a3 + b3) + b1 a2 (a3 + b3) + b1 b2 (a3 + b3) = a1 a2 a3 + a1 a2 b3 + a1 b2 a3 + a1 b2 b3 + b1 a2 a3 + b1 a2 b3 + b1 b2 a3 + b1 b2 b3 This result is showing that every possibly route to go down the vector. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 e.g. a1 a2 a3 [a1] [b1] | [a2] [b2] | [a3] [b3] e.g. a1 a2 b3 [a1] [b1] | [a2] [b2] \\ [a3] [b3] But what means by multiplying all possibly route and then add them up? The only sense I can make out of it that this arithematic is probabily dealing with \"probability\". Say there are 3 electron orbits. The probability that you will find an electron in there can be expressed by system c. And there is another 3 electron orbits expressed by system d. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 system c = [0.4] [0.2] [0.2] system d = [0.3] [0.5] [0.2] And magically system c and system d collides and they now sharing the same 3 orbits spacially. But still they are independent systems, just overlaping their orbits. Text Only 1 2 3 4 c d [0.4] [0.3] orbit1 [0.2] [0.5] orbit2 [0.2] [0.2] orbit3 Now 3 electrons filled all 3 orbits. One electron is in orbit1 but it is contributed by system c, and the chance to find an electron in system c orbit1 is 0.4. Another electron is in orbit2 but it is contributed by system d, and the chance to find an electron in system d orbit2 is 0.5. Another electron is in orbit3 but it is contributed by system c, and the chance to find an electron in system c orbit3 is 0.2. So the overall probability is 0.4 * 0.5 * 0.2. As ultimately there are 3 electrons there. There is a lot of different combination of the source of contributions. So you add up all those probilities. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 = a1 a2 a3 + a1 a2 b3 + a1 b2 a3 + a1 b2 b3 + b1 a2 a3 + b1 a2 b3 + b1 b2 a3 + b1 b2 b3 = arbitrary real number But then the result is a number. What is the meaning of this number? The total probility that I will find 3 electrons in such compond system? My real question is, what is this number means by a matrix operation?

Par2 is. \u00b6 Par2 is a opensource file archive and repair software. I know nothing about its history but it is awesome! I used to buy a bunch of external HDD and copy every file onto it. Having multiple copies across different physical HDD is essentially RAID1 mirroring, but it is painful when I need to move new files in and to edit old files. Then here comes my savier, PAR2. You archive your files with it, then it is able to detect any changes happened on your files and able to repair it, if the data loss is still manageable. For example, JPG is susceptible to data corruption. There are high energy particles hitting the ground every second, it is called radiation from the sky. When those particles hits the memory storage, that changes some bits. The probability is not high, still it is high enough to corrupt 10 to 20 photos in my phone and harddisk per year. PAR2 can fix this by repairing. Even if the file is completely gone. You can download Par2 software in Github. It is call MultiPar, made by the original author. Download \u00b6 You should scroll down and find Assets , download for example MultiPar1326_setup.exe and install it. https://github.com/Yutaka-Sawada/MultiPar/releases Installing \u00b6 While you are installing, there should by a option to create a button in the right-click menu. You should enable it. It gives better experience. Using \u00b6 Now that you finished installing. Let say you got a bunch of files pending to archive. put them to the same folder inside the folder select all right click MultiPar > Create Recovery Files the GUI should show up Let me explain the interface. And where should you look at. 1. This is the datas that you selected to archive. \u00b6 Right below the (1) that I draw, it said Splie Files . Don't ever tick it. Say if you have one 4GB video, ticking it will chop your video into pieces like 1GB-1GB-1GB-1GB and these are the ones who are going to be archived. 2. Block Count. \u00b6 It means that datas that you selected to archive is splited as many blocks. The software will calculate hash and parity for each block. 3. Block Size. \u00b6 Depend on how many blocks you decide to split. For example 1GB data into 4 blocks, which is 250MB for each block. 4. Number of Recovery blocks. \u00b6 How many extra data you are going to keep, to revovery the data loss. Let say you decided to split up 200 blocks in (2), here you select 40 of them as revovery blocks to make a extra copy of it. This give you 40/200 = 20% redundancy. You can make it 200% redundancy if you want, so that you can rebuild everything bit of data even when the original ones are all gone. You may consider to make it a multiple of (2) block count. 5. Number of Recovery files. \u00b6 Data blocks in (4) are gathered together as a single file. Here you can choose how many files will be saved on your disk. you can press Preview button in the bottom right conner to see how it will look like. 6. Efficiency. \u00b6 How efficient is this archive. For example if you have 8MB block size in (3) and your data that being archived are all small 5MB JPG photos, there is still 8-5 = 3MB of space for each block. The efficiency will be low. For that, you can slide the bar in (2) and see how the number in Recovery data size below (5) changes. So that you make it more efficient. But as the author said, < 3% different in efficiency is almost no difference. If you are archiving a bunch of small files, you better zip them before doing this PAR2 thing. 7. One thing you should be alert to \u00b6 is the long sentence in the bottom right conner Number of files can be fully reconstructed if missing (Min - Max) . Try to make the numbers look legit. For exsample Max0 means you are not able to rebuild any file at all with the current settings. If you accidentally deleted something, it is deleted forever. Max1 is also a bad idea. For example you only have a big zip file to archive. And the redundancy is lower than 100%. If you accidentally deleted that zip file, it is also deleted forever. You should split the zip file into many chunks. When you think it is OK, you can press Preview button in the bottom right conner to see what is going to happen. And if that is OK too, you may click Create to actually run the hash program, and wait until it finished. After it finished, there should be some .par2 files being made in the folder. You can double click on any of them, you should be able to call out MultiPar window. There you can check if anything is corrupted, if yes, you can press repair to repair it. My personal tip is not to archive too many files at once. Because the hash is being calcutated for all files as a whole. If you archive say 40GB or 60GB of files at once, every time you need to check for 60GB + 15GB (25% redundency) to look for any inconsistency, even though all you want to do is to repair 1MB of data among them. 20GB is a sweet spot for me. But it is still kind of slow. You figure it out yourself.","title":"NAS is not backup.

Max1 is also a bad idea. For example you only have a big zip file to archive. And the redundancy is lower than 100%. If you accidentally deleted that zip file, it is also deleted forever. You should split the zip file into many chunks. When you think it is OK, you can press Preview button in the bottom right conner to see what is going to happen. And if that is OK too, you may click Create to actually run the hash program, and wait until it finished. After it finished, there should be some .par2 files being made in the folder. You can double click on any of them, you should be able to call out MultiPar window. There you can check if anything is corrupted, if yes, you can press repair to repair it. My personal tip is not to archive too many files at once. Because the hash is being calcutated for all files as a whole. If you archive say 40GB or 60GB of files at once, every time you need to check for 60GB + 15GB (25% redundency) to look for any inconsistency, even though all you want to do is to repair 1MB of data among them. 20GB is a sweet spot for me.

It show you stuff. Python 1 print ( 10 ) Type \u00b6 type() tell you the type of the object. Python 1 2 type ( 3 ) type ( \"3\" ) Number \u00b6 Number in Python is just written like a number. Python 1 2 3 type ( 3 ) type ( 3.0 ) type ( 3.0 + 7 j ) String \u00b6 String is different from number. Python 1 2 3 type ( \"3\" ) type ( \"3.0\" ) type ( \"3.0+7j\" ) Changing Type \u00b6 By now you should know that type(3) is int and type(\"3\") is str . This type can also use as a transform function. Python 1 2 print ( str ( 3 ), type ( str ( 3 )) print ( int ( \"3.0\" ), type ( int ( \"3.0\" ))) Variable \u00b6 Just like 3x = y in school algebra, x and y are variable. Variable is a name. There is a value behind the name. Python 1 2 3 4 x = 3 print ( x ) x = 5 print ( x ) Comment \u00b6 Comment is not part of the program. Python do not excute the part you written as a comment by default. # indicate stuffs behind is intended to be a comment. Python 1 2 3 4 x = 3 #print(x) x = 5 #print(x) You can see nothing is being output. Since those lines for outputing stuffs on screen are now comments. For the sake of convenient, now I use comment to show the output of certain line. Operation \u00b6 Python 1 2 3 4 5 x = 3 y = 2 print ( x + y ) # 5 print ( x - y ) # 1 print ( x * y ) # 6 Condition \u00b6 Condition is simple. If this do this else do that. Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 x = 3 if x == 3 : # equality in Pythin is denoted by 2 `=` sign print ( True ) else : print ( False ) # True x = 5 # change the value if x == 3 : print ( True ) else : print ( False ) # False x = 5 if x == 3 : print ( True ) elif x == 5 : # adding second condition print ( True ) else : print ( False ) # True Temporary variable \u00b6 Temporary variable is like this: temp := some condition . When the condition is evaluated as True, that value is assigned to the variable name temp . Usually using with condition. Below is the conventional code. Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 name = \"John\" if name == \"Mary\" : # Checking equality message = name == \"Mary\" print ( message ) else : print ( \"Not Mary\" ) You want to print the value if name == \"Mary\" but this code do not seem smart. Use temporary variable Python 1 2 3 4 5 name = \"John\" if message := ( name == \"Mary\" ): print ( message ) else : print ( \"Not Mary\" ) When the value of name == \"Mary\" is not False, it will be assigned to variable name message . What means by is not False ? It is that the string is not empty, the string is not evaluated as False. Range \u00b6 Provided a upper bound and a lower bound, you can count numbers. You can ask if a value is within the range. Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 x = range ( 0 , 10 ) print ( x ) # range(0, 10) print ( 3 in x ) # True print ( 4 in x ) # True print ( 11 in x ) # False print ( 10 in x ) # False # Because in Python, the stopping point 10 is not included print ( - 10 in x ) # False List \u00b6 List is a list. For example name list, a bunch of names inside a single list. list() is a function that can change some specific stuff into a list. Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 x = [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] print ( x ) # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] x = list ( range ( 0 , 5 )) print ( x ) # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] print ( 0 in x ) # True print ( 5 in x ) # False print ( 10 in x ) # False Check how many stuffs are in the list. len() stands for length. Python 1 2 x = [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] print ( len ( x )) # 5 N dimensional List \u00b6 You can put anything insided a List, including a List itself. Python 1 2 x = [[ 0 , 1 ],[ 2 , 3 ],[ 4 , 5 ]] print ( x ) # [[0,1],[2,3],[4,5]] List index \u00b6 Stuffs inside a List count from 0. 0 th element, 1 st element, 2 nd elenment, and so on. Python 1 2 3 4 x = [ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ] print ( x [ 0 ]) # 6 # [0] means the first element print ( x [ 3 ]) # 9 print ( x [ - 1 ]) # 9 # [-1] means the last element List is mutable \u00b6 Stuff inside a List can be changed. Python 1 2 3 x = [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] x [ 0 ] = 99 print ( x ) # [99, 6, 7, 8] List contain a reference \u00b6 id() is how you can check the memory address of a object. Python 1 2 3 4 x = 8 print ( id ( x )) # 2369491173840 # this value depends because it is the memory address x = [ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 ] print ( id ( x [ 2 ]))) # 2369491173840 You see that both return the same value. Both are referencing to the same memory address. In Python, number/interger is inmutable and everytime you callit, it refers to the same object. Unless you do not want this feature on purpose. So there is \"imutable\" object in Python. Of cos, there is \"mutable\" object in Python. One of this kind is the List we are looking right now. So when you put a List inside another List, you are puting the reference of the List only, not the elements inside of the first list. Hence when you change the element, the changes happen to everywhere. Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 y = [ 0 , 1 ] x = [ y , y , y ] print ( x ) # [[0, 1], [0, 1], [0, 1]] print ( id ( x [ 0 ]), id ( x [ 1 ]), id ( x [ 2 ])) # 2369531363840 2369531363840 2369531363840 y [ 0 ] = 99 print ( x ) # [[99, 1], [99, 1], [99, 1]] # All inner List changed at once List copying \u00b6 To prevent the global changes of element, you have to create new object for each of them. Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 x = [ 0 , 1 ] y = [ 0 , 1 ] z = [ 0 , 1 ] mylist = [ x , y , z ] x [ 0 ] = 99 print ( mylist ) # [[99, 1], [0, 1], [0, 1]] Or you may use the copy() function from List itself. But also, it only give you the reference of its elements. When the element is another list, it is the same object before and after copying. Let's first see how List.copy() work in action. Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 x = [ 0 , 1 ] x2 = x . copy () print ( x2 ) # [0, 1] x2 [ 0 ] = 99 print ( x ) # [0, 1] print ( x2 ) # [99, 1] You can see original x is not affected because element of x is number/integer and it is imutable. And imutable object is the end of the journey, you cannot reassign another value to that memory address. Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 x = [[ 0 , 1 ], [ 2 , 3 ]] x2 = x . copy () print ( x ) # [[0,1], [2,3]] print ( x2 ) # [[0,1], [2,3]] x2 [ 1 ][ 1 ] = 99 print ( x ) # [[0, 1], [2, 99]] print ( x2 ) # [[0, 1], [2, 99]] print ( id ( x [ 1 ])) # 2369531365120 print ( id ( x2 [ 1 ])) # 2369531365120 x2[1] refer to the inner List [2,3] . x2[1][1] means that we are changing the second value of this inner List to 99 . By print the memory address, you can see that both refer to the same object. Hence when you change one side, the other side also changed. Deepcopy \u00b6 In the previous section, we see that modifying a N dimension List will have some unwanted side effect. How to prevent that? Here comes a function that is handy but if not careful enough, it hurt the performance a lot. Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 from copy import deepcopy x = [[ 0 , 1 ], [ 2 , 3 ]] x2 = deepcopy ( x ) print ( x ) # [[0,1], [2,3]] print ( x2 ) # [[0,1], [2,3]] print ( id ( x [ 1 ])) # 2369531365760 print ( id ( x2 [ 1 ])) # 2369531346624 # See that they do the share the same memory address x2 [ 1 ][ 1 ] = 99 print ( x ) # [[0, 1], [2, 3]] print ( x2 ) # [[0, 1], [2, 99]] Remember to use deepcopy() carefully. Do not make unnecessary copy. Loop \u00b6 One of the greatest thing in programming is that you can repeat same task for many times. This ability is called looping . Mainly, there are two types of loop in Python. For loop and WHITE loop . For loop \u00b6 Python 1 2 3 4 5 x = [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] for number in x : print ( number ) # 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 for number in range ( 5 ): print ( number ) # 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 For loop with condition \u00b6 Python 1 2 3 for number in range ( 5 ): if number > 2 : # Larger than print ( number ) # 3 -> 4 For loop break continue pass \u00b6 You can stop the For loop manually by break . Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 for num in range ( 7 ); if num < 3 : print ( num ) else : print ( \"Stoping the loop\" ) break Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 Stoping the loop You can skip the current cycle by continue . Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 for num in range ( 7 ); if num < 3 : print ( \"Skipping\" ) continue else : print ( num ) Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 Skipping Skipping 3 4 5 6 You can pretend that there is code but actually nothing. Python 1 2 for num in range ( 7 ); pass Nothing is being done inside the loop. But that still require some computational resource since it is still counting from 0 to 7. But pass is different from continue , pass is like a space holder but do not have the same functionality of continue . pass do not do skip. Python 1 2 3 for num in range ( 7 ); pass print ( num ) Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 N dimensional For loop \u00b6 For each layer of For loop, one element is being taken out from the list. When that element is also a list, you can use for loop on this element of list. Python 1 2 3 4 x = [[ 0 , 1 ],[ 2 , 3 ],[ 4 , 5 ]] for layer1 in x : for layer2 in layer1 : print ( layer2 ) # 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 By changing the position of function print() , or stuff inside function print() , you can obtain different effect. Python 1 2 3 4 5 x = [[ 0 , 1 ],[ 2 , 3 ],[ 4 , 5 ]] for layer1 in x : print ( \"Now\" , layer1 ) # Now [0,1] -> Now [2,3] for layer2 in layer1 : print ( layer2 ) #-> 0 -> 1 -> 2 ... So the overall printing will be: Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 Now [0,1] 0 1 Now [2,3] 2 3 Enumerate \u00b6 When it become confusing to make sense of N dimensional Loop, use enumerate() . Python 1 2 3 x = [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] for i , number in enumerate ( x ): print ( \"element\" , i , \"=\" , number ) # element 0 = 0 -> element 1 = 1 -> ... More typical usage of enumerate() is like this. Python 1 2 3 4 5 x = [[[ 0 , 0 ],[ 1 , 1 ]],[[ 2 , 2 ],[ 3 , 3 ]],[[ 4 , 4 ],[ 5 , 5 ]]] # This is a 3 dimension List for i , d1 in enumerate ( x ): for j , d2 in enumerate ( d1 ): for k , d3 in enumerate ( d2 ): print ( i , j , k , d3 ) # 0 0 0 0 -> 0 0 1 0 -> 0 1 0 1 -> ... So that you know which dimension is which. Building List using For loop \u00b6 You can put stuff into empty list by List.append() . Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 mylist = [] for number in range ( 5 ): mylist . append ( number ) print ( \"adding number\" , number , \"to the list.\" ) # adding number 0 to the list. -> ... print ( \">>> my list :\" , mylist ) # >>> my list : [0] -> >>> my list : [0, 1] -> ... print ( mylist ) # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] Decompose List using For loop \u00b6 Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 x = [[[ 0 , 0 ],[ 1 , 1 ]],[[ 2 , 2 ],[ 3 , 3 ]],[[ 4 , 4 ],[ 5 , 5 ]]] # This is a 3 dimension List y = [] for i , d1 in enumerate ( x ): for j , d2 in enumerate ( d1 ): for k , d3 in enumerate ( d2 ): y . append ( d3 ) print ( y ) # [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5] # N dimension is reduced to 1 dimension List comprehension \u00b6 The building process of a list and the expression of For loop can be compressed into a single line. [] construct a List. for name in namelist make a For loop. By combining both, you can make a List in one line of code. Python 1 2 x = [ number for number in range ( 5 )] print ( x ) # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] This is the same as: Python 1 2 3 x = [] for number in range ( 5 ): x . append ( number ) List comprehension with condition \u00b6 Python 1 2 x = [ number for number in range ( 5 ) if number > 2 ] print ( x ) # [3, 4] This is the same as: Python 1 2 3 4 5 x = [] for number in range ( 5 ): if number > 2 : # if number larger than 2 x . append ( number ) # x = [3, 4] N dimensional List comprehension \u00b6 Python 1 x = [[[ i , j ] for j in range ( 3 )] for i in range ( 2 )] This is the same as: Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 x = [] for i in range ( 2 ): innerlayer = [] for j in range ( 3 ): temp = [ i , j ] innerlayer . append ( temp ) x . append ( innerlayer ) # x = [[[0,0], [0,1], [0,2]], # [[1,0], [1,1], [1,2]]] You can use this method to build a empty matrix. Python 1 2 3 x = [[ 0 for j in range ( 3 )] for i in range ( 2 )] # x = [[0, 0, 0], # [0, 0, 0]] List comprehension with temporary variable \u00b6 Python 1 2 x = [ val for num in range ( 10 ) if ( val := num % 2 ) ] # x = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] Explained: Counting from 0 to 10, not include 10. num%2 means remainder after num is divided by 2. It the remainder is nonzero, it means True to Python. Therefore, If the number has remainder after divided by 2, assign this remainder to the new List x. So eventually you obtain a List full of 1. By changing num%1 to num%4 , you got the x mod 4 in algebra. Python 1 2 x = [ val for num in range ( 10 ) if ( val := num % 4 ) ] # x = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1] WHILE loop \u00b6 WHILE loop is like this: While the condition is True, do the following non stoply . Python 1 2 3 4 5 x = 0 while x < 2 : print ( x ) x += 1 print ( 999 ) Output: Text Only 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 999 Explained: Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Begining at 0 check if (0 < 2) => YUP print the current value = 0 current value plus 1 (current value = 1) check if (1 < 2) => YUP print the current value = 1 current value plus 1 (current value = 2) check if (2 < 2) => YUP print the current value = 2 current value plus 1 (current value = 3) check if (3 < 2) => NOPE stop looping print value 999 While True and break \u00b6 Sometimes it is just more convenient to do the loop first, check the condition then. Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 x = 0 while True : x += 1 print ( x ) if x > 5 : print ( \"x is now larger than 5\" ) break Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 x is now larger than 5 The usage depend on you. But never forget to end the loop. Otherwise it is called infinite loop. The loop will never end. And Python can not tell itself is doing infinite loop of if the loop is going to end. When you wait so long and still not seeing the result of your program, probably you wrote some infinite loop back there. While Continue Pass \u00b6 Same usage as For loop. While Comprehension \u00b6 As far as I know there is no such thing in Python (or is it?) Dictionary \u00b6 Vocabulary -> Meaning. This is the Dictionary. Creating a connected pair. Or mathematically speaking, a mapping (hey no one understand this!). Python 1 2 x = { \"A\" : \"Apple\" , \"B\" : \"Bob\" } x [ \"A\" ] # \"Apple\" Dictionary is constructed by {} . Inside this curvy braket, key : value . A for Apple B for Bob! When extrating the value back, use the same syntax of List indexing. Calling x[\"A\"] like asking the Dictionary hey what is connected to \"A\"? The Dictionary anwser you Oh it is \"Apple\". Dictionary Construction \u00b6 Well almost same as if this is a list. But a little different. Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 x = {} # Empty Dictionary initials = [ \"A\" , \"B\" , \"C\" ] for initial in initials : if initial == \"A\" : value = \"Apple\" elif initial == \"B\" : value = \"Bob\" elif value == \"C\" : value = \"Catastrophe\" else : value = \"Unknow\" x [ initial ] = value print ( x ) # {\"A\": \"Apple\", \"B\": \"Bob\" , \"C\": \"Catastrophe\"} But this code do not seem smart. Then, use zip() . zip() combine two or more stream of data into one, so that you can write a for loop for it! Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 x = {} # Empty Dictionary initials = [ \"A\" , \"B\" , \"C\" ] values = [ \"Apple\" , \"Bob\" , \"Catastrophe\" ] for ( initial , value ) in zip ( initials , values ): x [ initial ] = value print ( x ) # {\"A\": \"Apple\", \"B\": \"Bob\" , \"C\": \"Catastrophe\"} Zip Dictionary Construction \u00b6 zip() usage in the previous section. We can make use of that and write just a fewer code to achieve the same thing. Python 1 2 3 4 initials = [ \"A\" , \"B\" , \"C\" ] values = [ \"Apple\" , \"Bob\" , \"Catastrophe\" ] x = dict ( zip ( initials , values )) print ( x ) # {\"A\": \"Apple\", \"B\": \"Bob\" , \"C\": \"Catastrophe\"} zip() combine two list, and dict() turn this combined stream of data into a Dictionary. But this only work if stuff inside zip() make a pair. If you have something like zip(list1, list2, list3) , this do not work. What you need is the next technique. Dictionary Comprehension \u00b6 Just like List Comprehension, there is Dictionary Comprehension too. Given that {} make a Dictionary, just like [] make a List, you can do this. The syntax is only differ from List Comprehension by a little. Basically this is just the code from previous section with different ordering. Python 1 2 3 4 initials = [ \"A\" , \"B\" , \"C\" ] values = [ \"Apple\" , \"Bob\" , \"Catastrophe\" ] x = { initial : value for ( initial , value ) in zip ( initials , values ) } print ( x ) # {\"A\": \"Apple\", \"B\": \"Bob\" , \"C\": \"Catastrophe\"} By Dictionary Comprehension, you can now do zip(list1, list2, list3) . Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 initials = [ \"A\" , \"B\" , \"C\" ] values = [ \"Apple\" , \"Bob\" , \"Catastrophe\" ] values2 = [ \"Amos\" , \"Behemoth\" , \"Ceres\" ] x = { initial : [ value , value2 ] for ( initial , value , value2 ) in zip ( initials , values , values2 ) } print ( x ) # {\"A\": [\"Apple\", \"Amos\"], \"B\": [\"Bob\", \"Behemoth\"] , \"C\": [\"Catastrophe\", \"Ceres\"]} print ( x [ \"A\" ]) # [\"Apple\", \"Amos\"] # The value is now a list. As you see from this demostration, everything can be assigned as a value of Dictionary including number, string, List, Dictionary... But not the key. For a key, Dictionary require you to have a unique key for each object. But is way beyond comprehension of a begineer, so you can totally ignore this fact. Just try if you are not certain. Sometime Python will stop you from doing that. Try using a list as a key of Dictionary like the following code. Python 1 2 3 4 x = {} key = [ 0 , 1 , 2 ] value = \"my list\" x [ key ] = value # This line will raise error Enumerate Dictionary \u00b6 Dictionary provide the fastest way to access a value by its key. But what if you want the inverted version: access a key by its value? For example a List, you want to know the List index of certain string. Here you can combine Dict Comprehension and function enumerate() to achieve that. Python 1 2 3 values = [ \"Amos\" , \"Behemoth\" , \"Ceres\" ] lookup = { x : i for ( i , x ) in enumerate ( values ) } lookup [ \"Behemoth\" ] # 1 # tell you that it is at position 1 But this only work if and only if the element inside the List is all unique. For example when you have two Amos [\"Amos\", \"Amos\", \"Behemoth\", \"Ceres\"], the information from the first entry is being covered by the second entry. So the resulting lookup dictionary will only store it Amos is in position 1, not [0,1]. For multiple entry, you need to write a normal For loop. Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 values = [ \"Amos\" , \"Amos\" , \"Behemoth\" , \"Ceres\" ] lookup = {} for ( i , value ) in enumerate ( values ): if value not in lookup : lookup [ value ] = [ i ] else : lookip [ value ] . append ( i ) Now you may ask if that if value not in lookup: checking is cumbersome because it actually is. So there is a better solution for this. A DefaultDict. DefaultDict \u00b6 First you need to tell the DefaultDict, what is your default value if the key is not being assigned to the dict. This time you say you want a list as default. So that DefaultDict will create a empty list for you. Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 from collections import defaultdict x = defaultdict ( list ) values = [ \"Amos\" , \"Amos\" , \"Behemoth\" , \"Ceres\" ] lookup = {} for ( i , value ) in enumerate ( values ): lookip [ value ] . append ( i ) # now you do not need to check for `value in lookup` Tuple \u00b6 Tuple is the imutable version of List. And because Tuple is imutable, you can assign it as a key of a Dictionary! Python 1 2 3 4 5 this_is_a_tuple = ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) print ( this_is_a_tuple ) # (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) print ( type ( this_is_a_tuple )) 3 tuple this_is_a_list = [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] print ( this_is_a_list ) # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] Python 1 2 3 4 5 x = {} key = ( 0 , 1 , 2 ) value = \"my list\" x [ key ] = value # Success print ( x ) # {(0, 1, 2): \"my list\"} Imutable \u00b6 Almost everything is same as a List except that now you cannot change the content inside a Tuple. Python 1 2 x = ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ) x [ - 1 ] = 99 # You can not do this But just as what you have learnt from the section of referencing, Tuple only keep track of the first layer of reference. If you put List inside a Tuple, you can not change the List, but you can change stuff inside that List. Python 1 2 3 4 x = ([ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ],) # Tuple need you to type that comma if there is only one element print ( x [ 0 ]) # [0,1,2,3] x [ 0 ][ - 1 ] = 99 print ( x ) # x = ([0,1,2,99],) But you can do this does not mean that you should do this. Tupling \u00b6 Just lke you can turn something into a List by using function list() , you can almost do the same thing with function tuple() . Python 1 2 3 4 x = list ( range ( 5 )) print ( x , type ( x )) # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] list x = tuple ( range ( 5 )) print ( x , type ( x )) # (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) tuple Tuple Comprehension \u00b6 Do not like List or Dictionary, for Tuple, you need to use function tuple() to write a comprehension. Python 1 2 3 4 5 x = [ val for num in range ( 10 ) if ( val := num % 4 ) ] # x = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1] x = tuple ( val for num in range ( 10 ) if ( val := num % 4 ) ) # x = (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1) Itemgetter \u00b6 Function itemgetter() comes handy when you need to obtain multiple element from a List of from a Tuple of from a Dictionary at once. Usually people do this. Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 x = [ \"Amos\" , \"Amos\" , \"Behemoth\" , \"Ceres\" ] need = [ 0 , 2 , 3 ] y = [] for index in need : y . append ( x [ index ]) print ( y ) # [\"Amos\", \"Behemoth\", \"Ceres\"] Stop doing this. Use itemgetter. Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 x = [ \"Amos\" , \"Amos\" , \"Behemoth\" , \"Ceres\" ] need = [ 0 , 2 , 3 ] from operator import itemgetter y = itemgetter ( 0 , 2 , 3 )( x ) print ( y ) # (\"Amos\", \"Behemoth\", \"Ceres\") y = itemgetter ( * need )( x ) print ( y ) # (\"Amos\", \"Behemoth\", \"Ceres\") If you obtaining multiple stuff, Itemgetter return a Tuple. If you obtain only single stuff, itemgetter return that single object without putting it in any List or Tuple. You need to be careful with this. Since tou can use * to unpack a List or Tuple even if that List or Tuple contain only single element. But since you are using * to unpack something, you are expecting many things inside. Really, be careful of this behaviour. But first of all what means by \"use * to unpack a List or Tuple\" ??? This is explained in the following section. But before that, just one more thing. You can use itemgetter() to extract element from 2 dimension List. Python 1 2 3 4 x = [[ 0 , 1 ],[ 2 , 3 ],[ 4 , 5 ]] # let say you want the first element from each sub-List from operator import itemgetter y = map ( itemgetter ( 0 ), x ) # 0 means index 0 of List. print ( y ) # (0, 2, 4) map(itemgetter(0), x) is like a idiom, so remenber it. Multiple Unpack \u00b6 Python 1 2 3 4 5 x = {} # Empty Dictionary initials = [ \"A\" , \"B\" , \"C\" ] values = [ \"Apple\" , \"Bob\" , \"Catastrophe\" ] for ( initial , value ) in zip ( initials , values ): x [ initial ] = value You have seen this in the section of Dictionary. You should have ask the question \"What is that for (initial, value) in zip( ? \" This is called multiple unpack in Python. Pairs are being returned from function zip() , and you assign a each of them to a variable name initial and value . Basically this act the same as following code. Python 1 2 3 4 for pair in zip ( initials , values ): initial = pair [ 0 ] value = pair [ 1 ] x [ initial ] = value With multiple unpack, we can just split and asign each element inside a Tuple or a List of something work like them with a variable name. Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 x = [ 0 , 99 ] a , b = x print ( a ) # 0 print ( b ) # 99 x = [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] head , * middle , end = x # `*` indicate that contain multiple stuff inside print ( head ) # 0 print ( middle ) # [1, 2, 3] print ( end ) # [4] y = [ head , middle , end ] print ( y ) # [0, [1, 2, 3], 4] y = [ head , * middle , end ] # with `*` for middle, you unpack stuffs inside print ( y ) # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] Although multiple unpack is useful, do not addict to it. Sometimes it comes with performance penalty like the following. Python 1 2 3 a , b , c = tuple ([ 0 , 0 , 0 ]) # never do this a , b , c = ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) # never do this a = b = c = 0 # do this, if the value is a number. Number is imutable Set \u00b6 So you know there is List, Tuple, Dictionary. There is one more: Set . Set share the same symbol as Dictionary. But to build a Set, you need to call the function set() . Python 1 2 x = set () print ( type ( x )) # set Python 1 2 3 4 x = { 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } print ( type ( x )) # set x = { 0 , 0 , 3 , 3 , 4 } print ( x ) # {0, 3, 4} # only unique element are stored in Set Building a Set using For loop \u00b6 Python 1 2 3 4 5 x = [ 0 for num in range ( 5 )] # a List full of 0 myset = set () for num in x : myset . add ( num ) # contrast to `List.append()`, You use `Set.add()` print ( myset ) # {0} Set Comprehension \u00b6 Well, there has List Comprehension, Dict Comprehension, no Tuple Comprehension, but there has Set Comprehension. It is just [ for the List thing replaced by { . Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 x = [ val for num in range ( 10 ) if ( val := num % 4 ) ] # x = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1] x = tuple ( val for num in range ( 10 ) if ( val := num % 4 ) ) # x = (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1) x = { val for num in range ( 10 ) if ( val := num % 4 ) } # x = {1, 2, 3} Setting \u00b6 Python 1 2 3 x = ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 1 ) y = { num for num in x } # Never write this y = set ( x ) # just slap function `set()` to it List(Set(List)) \u00b6 For example you got a List x=[1,2,3,1,2,3,1], you want to eliminate duplicated elelment. Do this, list(set(List)). No matter what your algorithms textbook is saying, this is the known fastest way in Python. Python 1 2 3 x = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 1 ] y = list ( set ( x )) print ( y ) # [1, 2, 3] Set Relation \u00b6 Make use of set relationship. You can make the fastest program out of them. Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 x = { 0 , 1 , 2 } y = { 2 , 3 , 4 } x . intersection ( y ) # {2} x & y # {2} x . isdisjoint ( y ) # False x . update ( y ) # {0,1,2,3,4} x | y # {0,1,2,3,4} x . difference ( y ) # {0,1} x - y # {0,1} Want More? \u00b6","title":"Essential Python Programming (for begineer)"},{"location":"python/Essential%20Python%20Programming%20%28for%20begineer%29/#essential-python-programming-for-begineer","text":"","title":"Essential Python Programming (for begineer)"},{"location":"python/Essential%20Python%20Programming%20%28for%20begineer%29/#print","text":"print() is the first step of Python.

So there is \"imutable\" object in Python. Of cos, there is \"mutable\" object in Python. One of this kind is the List we are looking right now.

It will grow into bigger size when you need more. But that growing also takes time. As you append more and more items into the list, or the dict, soon it may again fulled and need another growth. When this happens a lot, it takes a lot of time to deal with the memory space arrangement. Therefore given that you know how many resources you need, you can preallocate that amount of memory.

Some not-so-important proof are completely omited from the text. Which avoid digress from the main storyline. This will be discussed later. learn through examples \u00b6 Unlike those exampleless math textbooks, this textbook is basically composited by a ton of worked out examples. Starting with some simple ones, then some variation of the patterns, and then introducing more advanced concept and skill through more examples. Usually 3 examples for 1 concept. The answers are all step-by-step guide. I believe that human learn better with examples rather than boring text and axioms. Just like researchs failed in making artifical intellegence in the early days, but then they gain a great success these days as soon as they realise that it is the matter of the volume of examples i.e. training data, and iterations. Most textbook failed at teaching anything but this book is different. barrier-free \u00b6 But I would argue that the examples and problems are a bit too easy. If you are pusuring competitive exams, this may not for you. But think of this, what is the point of making examples and problems insanely difficult to a beginer? Books for beginers should help student to build their confidence and attitude toware the subject instead of torturing. It is meaningless to make the learning curve so steep. It can only be a barrier instead of a ladder. You are doing so to keep people out from knowledge and keep the unknowledged and poverty. chapters are ordered structurally \u00b6 Obviously the authors sorted the chapters intentionally just like the my favorite mentioned above. I can see there is a clear dependence tree made behind the scene. In particular, You don't need to know integral before you do partital derivative. Also you need to know both integral and derivative to do differential equation. And there is another consideration: clustering the related topics so that reader will can carry on to more advance topic before they forget. This is the order of chapters after considering the dependence tree: derivative partial derivative integral multiple integral differential equation While other \"formal\" calculus is like: derivative integral differential equation partial derivative multiple integral differential equation This kind of ordering obviously did not account for the memory loss nature of human readers. And in fact this happens to me. I almost forget anything from the derivative while I was looking at partial derivate, after the lengthy chapter of integral and applications of integral. almost typo-free \u00b6 I worked out almost pages and the examples, found almost no typo. Except where placese should be \"cosecant\", are left empty. Mystery. What is lacking in the book? \u00b6 Obviously there are handful of advanced topics are absent from this book. Especiallly those you are able to find in other commersial university calculus textbook. rigious establishment of the concept \"limit\" and Delta-Epsilon-Theorem but I will argue that this is totally unnecessary since the concept of limit is easy, it is just the mathematical definition is written ugly. the fundamental theorem of calculus but the authurs does introduc it conceptually and without the name of it. I would say acceptible. My favorite \u00b6 The introduction to complex number and the following hyperbolic function are fantasic. First they introduce trigonometry function such as sin cos tan. Then complex number. After that there is the Taylor Expansion of sin cos. So reader will know that complex number can be expressed in the form of Text Only 1 r[ cos(x) + isin(x) ]. Next, they introduce the concept of add and even function. Gradually carry to the point that hyperbolic sine and cosine is the odd and even part of e^ix. This conneced complex number to hyperboic functions. Lastly, what if we do sinh(ix) instead of sinh(x)? After working out, turn out hyperbolic function with a complex number being inputed is normal trigonometry. The author spend a great effor to show me that Text Only 1 [trigonometry - complex number - hyperbolic function] are all connected. At the end I am shocked by this discovery. Now I feel I finally understand what a hyperbolic function is. This is a Ah-Ha moment that other formal calculus book fail to gave me. Summary \u00b6 Engineering Mathematic by Booth and Stroud is a epic unconventional book for you to learn and refresh the basics of college level mathematics. It covers a lot of topics and kindly provides insane amount of worked example for readers. This book is the corner stone in math pedagogy. No one can unsee this book after seeing it.","title":"Engineering Mathematics by Booth and Stroud - A Pedagogic Approach Toward Mathematical Maturity"},{"location":"review_book/Engineering%20Mathematics%20By%20K.A.%20Stroud%2C%20Dexter%20J.%20Booth/#engineering-mathematics-by-booth-and-stroud-a-pedagogic-approach-toward-mathematical-maturity","text":"I spended 1.5 month reading and working out this 1100-pages book:","title":"Engineering Mathematics by Booth and Stroud - A Pedagogic Approach Toward Mathematical Maturity"},{"location":"review_book/Engineering%20Mathematics%20By%20K.A.%20Stroud%2C%20Dexter%20J.%20Booth/#title","text":"Engineering Mathematics by Booth and Stroud.

Starting with some simple ones, then some variation of the patterns, and then introducing more advanced concept and skill through more examples. Usually 3 examples for 1 concept. The answers are all step-by-step guide. I believe that human learn better with examples rather than boring text and axioms. Just like researchs failed in making artifical intellegence in the early days, but then they gain a great success these days as soon as they realise that it is the matter of the volume of examples i.e. training data, and iterations. Most textbook failed at teaching anything but this book is different.","title":"learn through examples"},{"location":"review_book/Engineering%20Mathematics%20By%20K.A.%20Stroud%2C%20Dexter%20J.%20Booth/#barrier-free","text":"But I would argue that the examples and problems are a bit too easy. If you are pusuring competitive exams, this may not for you. But think of this, what is the point of making examples and problems insanely difficult to a beginer? Books for beginers should help student to build their confidence and attitude toware the subject instead of torturing. It is meaningless to make the learning curve so steep. It can only be a barrier instead of a ladder. You are doing so to keep people out from knowledge and keep the unknowledged and poverty.","title":"barrier-free"},{"location":"review_book/Engineering%20Mathematics%20By%20K.A.%20Stroud%2C%20Dexter%20J.%20Booth/#chapters-are-ordered-structurally","text":"Obviously the authors sorted the chapters intentionally just like the my favorite mentioned above. I can see there is a clear dependence tree made behind the scene. In particular, You don't need to know integral before you do partital derivative. Also you need to know both integral and derivative to do differential equation. And there is another consideration: clustering the related topics so that reader will can carry on to more advance topic before they forget. This is the order of chapters after considering the dependence tree: derivative partial derivative integral multiple integral differential equation While other \"formal\" calculus is like: derivative integral differential equation partial derivative multiple integral differential equation This kind of ordering obviously did not account for the memory loss nature of human readers. And in fact this happens to me. I almost forget anything from the derivative while I was looking at partial derivate, after the lengthy chapter of integral and applications of integral.","title":"chapters are ordered structurally"},{"location":"review_book/Engineering%20Mathematics%20By%20K.A.%20Stroud%2C%20Dexter%20J.%20Booth/#almost-typo-free","text":"I worked out almost pages and the examples, found almost no typo.

First they introduce trigonometry function such as sin cos tan. Then complex number. After that there is the Taylor Expansion of sin cos. So reader will know that complex number can be expressed in the form of Text Only 1 r[ cos(x) + isin(x) ]. Next, they introduce the concept of add and even function. Gradually carry to the point that hyperbolic sine and cosine is the odd and even part of e^ix. This conneced complex number to hyperboic functions. Lastly, what if we do sinh(ix) instead of sinh(x)? After working out, turn out hyperbolic function with a complex number being inputed is normal trigonometry. The author spend a great effor to show me that Text Only 1 [trigonometry - complex number - hyperbolic function] are all connected. At the end I am shocked by this discovery. Now I feel I finally understand what a hyperbolic function is.

What is commute What is Binary Operation Commutator in 20 word Pauli Operator What is Bloch Sphere Pauli Operator form a Cyclic Group How to Make Fast Commutator What is commute \u00b6 \"Commute\" is a algebraic property in mathematics. Let say that you have some operation. Say \"go to toilet\" and \"wash hand\". And when you execute those operation, in different order, the outcome and meaning is completely different. Text Only 1 2 go to toilet then wash hand wash hand then go to toilet However the best option should be Text Only 1 wash hand then go to toilet then wash hand Then we say \"go to toilet\" and \"wash hand\" is NOT COMMUTE. We cannot change the their order arbitrarily. So this is \"not commute\". Then what is \"commute\"? Think of \"walking front\" and \"walking left\". No matter what order you walk, you must go to the same after position. Then we say walking front\" and \"walking left\" is COMMUTE. When two operation is COMMUTE, they are INDEPENDENT operation with respect to each other. Doing one operation do not affect anything in another operation. Like moving up and down will not have any affection on the horizontal position of that thing. So a commutator is a function that we use to check whether two operation is commute with each other or not. It is a binary operation. What is Binary Operation \u00b6 \"Plus\" and \"Muliplication\" is binary operation. They are used to make a relationship of two object. Text Only 1 2 3 1 + 1 = 2 2 + 2 = 4 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 There is a machine called \"PLUS\" and you can only input two value into it. And then after that it produce a new value. Text Only 1 PLUS(1,1) => 2 This machine/function can take only two number. Likewise, commutator is binary operation. Commutator in 20 word \u00b6 Text Only 1 2 3 Let A, B be two operation. Check AB - BA ?= 0 Explain: if A and B commute, then AB should have the same value as BA. And because of that, when you subtract them, you are subtracting the same value. So the result must be zero. State it inversely. If AB subtract BA is not equal to zero, A and B is not commute to each other. Pauli Operator \u00b6 Pauli Operator a set of operation in quantum computing. They are denoted as Text Only 1 I, X, Y, Z In their matrix form Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 I := [ 1 0 ] [ 0 1 ] X := [ 0 1 ] [ 1 0 ] Y := [ 0 -i ] [ i 0 ] Z := [ 1 0 ] [ 0 -1 ] The \"i\" in Y is the \"i\" of imaginary number. Why is this name. Because they represented the rotation axis of Bloch Sphere. Each Pauli Operator mean that you rotate the Bloch Sphere in the same axis of its name. Text Only 1 2 3 4 I = identity = do not rotate X rotate 180 degree in X axis Y rotate 180 degree in Y axis Z rotate 180 degree in Z axis What is Bloch Sphere \u00b6 Bloch Sphere is used in vistualizing a quantum state. It is a ball, or a sphere, or a globe. But in fact this thing is totally useless in everyday quantum computing. But I think it might help you understanding more about how the proterty of \"commute\" related to Pauli Operator. So a sphere has three axis namely X Y Z. To introduce those axis. I would not tell you to take out you hand and say \"right hand rule\" or something like that because some folks may not have right hand. So instead I will use your head. Think of you head. There is a arrow sticking through your right and left ears. That is the X axis. Another arrow sticking through your nose and back of your head. That is Y axis. And the last arrow go through your neck and top of you head. That is Z axis. So you try rotating X axis. Rotate you head with respect to ear axis. Doing so, you point your head to the groud. And you find that your nose will not be facing the front any more. Your nose is facing the back now. And of course your head is pointing at different direction. Therefore you know that rotating X axis is not independent from Y and Z axis. Likewise, try rotate the Z axis. Namely, facing front, then turn your body 180 degree and now you are facing the back. And you know that you cannot do this without changing the direction of your nose and ears. Again, Z axis is not independent from X and Y axis. Therefore the action of rotating X Y Z axis is complely NOT COMMUTE. Same for the Pauli Operator. Text Only 1 2 3 XY != YX YZ != ZY ZX != XZ But one thing is independent. Let say you and your friend is standing side by side. No matter how your friend's head rotate, that do not affect you. Your head and your friend's head is completely independent from each other. This is the principle of Pauli Operator's tensor product. It is internally independent. Text Only 1 (Z1 Z2) x (X1) == (Z1 X2) x (Z2) == (ZX1 Z2) See that Z2 is unchanged. Because X1 only act on index 1. Although X1 is NON COMMUTE with Z1, it is COMMUTE with Z2. Pauli Operator form a Cyclic Group \u00b6 You do not need to know what mathematically a \"Group\" is. The only thing you need to know is this \"Cyclic Group\". So the problem is, yup Pauli Operator is NON COMMUTATIVE. But how can we predict the outcome of it? Here I write all the combination out. Let see you can spot out the pattern. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 XY == iZ YX == -iZ YZ == iX ZY == -iX ZX == iY XZ == -iY For the I, because it stand for Identity and do nothing, IX = X and XI = X, etc, so I omit it. And you can see whatever you do, the result must be something within {X, Y, Z}. That \"i\" is imaginary number. Usually we ignore it because i is also independent with all Pauli Operator. So the rule is, think of it as a circle of triangle. Counting XYZ clockwise and anticlockwise. Text Only 1 2 X Z Y X -> Y is clockwise, which is positive, and you got the next element Z. Hence iZ Y -> X is anticlockwise, so you must have negative, and then the next element Z. Hence -iZ. Same law apply to all others. Or you can do this. List out all possible combination in a string. Text Only 1 X Y Z X Y Z X Y Z Say, ZY, so you look for it and find the matching pattern Text Only 1 X Y Z X [Y <- Z] X Y Z And follow the direction of the arrow, the next element is X. Thus ZY = -iX because the arrow is pointing at left. This property is said to be the Cyclic Group. But what about XX, or YY, or ZZ? This is kind of simple. If the same thing happened twice, nothing happened after all. i.e Text Only 1 2 3 4 II == I XX == I YY == I ZZ == I Why is that. Because just as what I mention earlier, Text Only 1 X rotate 180 degree in X axis So what happen if you do operation X twice? Text Only 1 rotate 180 degree, and rotate 180 degree in X axis That is the same as Text Only 1 rotate 360 degree in X axis = Do not rotate at all You can verify all these in the matrix form if you know how to do matrix multiplication. Or with some help of computer program, you should be able to get the same result. How to Make Fast Commutator \u00b6 So these knowledge lay the foundation for implementing Commutator in a faster way. To avoid getting too theoretical, I will first show you how to work on real world example. Here is a matrix generated from H2 molecule. Don't worry if this is your first time to do chemical calculation. It is just a bunch of number and stuffs. I don't even know what they mean exactly. Knowing how to deal with Pauli Operator is just enough for the task. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 coefficient Pauli Operator -0.106 [I0 I1 I2 ] +0.045 [X0 Z1 X2 ] +0.045 [X0 Z1 X2 Z3] +0.045 [Y0 Z1 Y2 ] +0.045 [Y0 Z1 Y2 Z3] +0.173 [Z0 ] +0.173 [Z0 Z1 ] +0.166 [Z0 Z1 Z2 ] +0.166 [Z0 Z1 Z2 Z3] +0.120 [Z0 Z2 ] +0.120 [Z0 Z2 Z3] +0.168 [ Z1 ] -0.221 [ Z1 Z2 Z3] +0.174 [ Z1 Z3] -0.221 [ Z2 ] The task is, we have to check that if this is commute with the thing below. Text Only 1 2 coefficient Pauli Operator +1.0 [Z0 Z2] Let A be the first upper one, and B be the below one. We need to compute AB - BA ?= 0 . As we can see, A is a sum of a bunch of Pauli Operator. For this kind of thing, we can use distribution law. Text Only 1 W * ( E + R ) == WE + WR # distribution law Therefor instead of doing the whole big thing at once, we can just do a single slice of it at a time. Like taking the first term out of A and check whether AB = BA. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 A0 = -0.106 [I0 I1 I2] B = +1.0 [Z0 Z2] A0*B ?= B*A0 (-0.106 [I0 I1 I2] )(+1.0 [Z0 Z2] ) ?= (+1.0 [Z0 Z2] )(-0.106 [I0 I1 I2] ) We can just treat the coefficient as a coefficient, and Pauli Operator as a variable. We can split the task into two seperate part. Like 3y - 3y = 0, all we need to look at is Text Only 1 2 3 4 1. whether the coefficient is the same value. 2. whether the Pauli Operator is the exact same thing. (-0.106 * +1.0) [I0 I1 I2][Z0 Z2] ?= (+1.0 * -0.106) [Z0 Z2][I0 I1 I2] For the coefficient, since they are all number, they obey all law from algebra. Namely, commutative law and associative law of multiplication. Text Only 1 2 3 4 Let a,b,c be arbitrary number. a*b = b*a # commutative law a*b*c = a*(b*c) # associative law Therefore it do not matter you multiple two number left of right. Any order can produce the same value. Let say Ac is coefficient of A and Bc is of B, Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 Ac*Bc == Bc*Ac hence, Ac*Bc (AB) ?= Bc*Ac (BA) Ac*Bc (AB) ?= Ac*Bc (BA) # Ac*Bc = Bc*Ac (AB) ?= (BA) # cancel out Ac*Bc Absolutely we can ignore the coefficient, however, the only thing in coefficient that we have to worry about is the i produced after two non commute Pauli Operator multiplied together i.e. XY = iZ etc. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 e.g. K = X, L = Y KL ?= LK XY ?= YX iZ ?= -iZ iZ != -iZ So although both side got the same Pauli Z, the sign of i disagree. If you got more than one set of Pauli Operator multiplied, you have to count for how many i are produced and keep track of the sign. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 e.g. XY0 XY1 ?= YZ0 YZ1 iZ0 iZ1 ?= -iZ0 -iZ1 ii Z0 Z1 ?= --ii Z0 Z1 -1 Z0 Z1 ?= -1 Z0 Z1 -1 Z0 Z1 == -1 Z0 Z1 Almost the same configuration but this time commute. To conclue on issue among coefficient, only the i and their sign you should pay attention to. Other do not worth the effort because they are 100% sure to be the exact same value. So, lets focus on the Pauli Operator. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A0 = [I0 I1 I2] B = [Z0 Z2] A0*B ?= B*A0 For A0*B [I0 I1 I2][Z0 Z2] = [IZ0 I1 IZ2] You can see index 1 is not contained in B, so instead of doing the full length multiplication, we can just extract those index both A0 and B share. So the problem size is smaller. Text Only 1 [I0 I1 I2][Z0 Z2] = [I0 I2][Z0 Z2] = [IZ0 IZ2] Those index both A0 and B share are the main target. Still we need to see what is outside of main target. Here we can use the property of Pauli Operator that different index COMMUTE. So we don't need to care where to put them. Front of back, do not matter. Text Only 1 2 [IZ0 IZ2] -> {IZ0 IZ2}[I1] or [I1]{IZ0 IZ2} {}for target As I mention earlier, I stand for Identity thus it do nothing, therefore Text Only 1 {IZ0 IZ2} = {Z0 Z2} And since A0 contains only I, it is automatically known as commute. 100% sure. You don't even need to compute it. Text Only 1 because IZ = ZI, if only I is invlove, it must commute. Let see what if it is non commute. Text Only 1 2 3 4 A1 = +0.045 [X0 Z1 X2] B = +1.0 [Z0 Z2] A1*B ?= B*A1 Again, only need to check the targeted part. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A1 = +0.045 {X0 X2} B = +1.0 {Z0 Z2} A1*B ?= B*A1 XZ0 XZ2 ?= ZX0 ZX2 -iY0 -iY2 ?= iY0 iY2 --ii Y0 Y2 ?= ii Y0 Y2 Y0 Y2 == Y0 Y2 Appending the non targeted part, Text Only 1 Y0 Y2 Z1 == Y0 Y2 Z1 In fact you don't even need to check for the non targeted part to see whether all term match. The real power of Cyclic Group property of Pauli Operator is that it ensured that all tensor product of Pauli Operator is unique. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 We can seperate terms in such manner {target}[non target] The thing brother me is that target part will change accouding to what it is multiplied to. Like A3 = {target3}[non target3] A4 = {target4}[non target4] B = {targetB} A3*B != B*A3 by coefficient but if {target4 * targetB} == {target3} adding its coefficient to A3*B may lead to A3*B == B*A3 Will there be such situation? Turn out there is no such situation. Let say Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 A3 = {X}[non target3] A4 = {Y}[non target4] B = {Z} First of all, A3==A4 if and only if target3==target4, given they have exactly same [non target] term. So target3 must not be target4. Second, property from Cyclic Group ensure that A3*B != A4*B. XY = YX = Z YZ = ZY = X Third, since multiplying Pauli Operator is a binary operation, this make Cyclic Group 100% true. So by this uniqueness, we can do all comparison separately.","title":"Pauli Operator, Commutator, Bloch sphere,  Binary Operation, and Cyclic\u00a0Group"},{"location":"toward_science/Pauli%20Operator%2C%20Commutator%2C%20Bloch%20sphere%2C%20%20Binary%20Operation%2C%20and%20Cyclic%C2%A0Group/#pauli-operator-commutator-bloch-sphere-binary-operation-and-cyclic-group","text":"Sometimes a thing called \"Commutator\" is being used in Quantum Computing.

Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 We can seperate terms in such manner {target}[non target] The thing brother me is that target part will change accouding to what it is multiplied to. Like A3 = {target3}[non target3] A4 = {target4}[non target4] B = {targetB} A3*B != B*A3 by coefficient but if {target4 * targetB} == {target3} adding its coefficient to A3*B may lead to A3*B == B*A3 Will there be such situation?

Let say Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 A3 = {X}[non target3] A4 = {Y}[non target4] B = {Z} First of all, A3==A4 if and only if target3==target4, given they have exactly same [non target] term. So target3 must not be target4. Second, property from Cyclic Group ensure that A3*B != A4*B. XY = YX = Z YZ = ZY = X Third, since multiplying Pauli Operator is a binary operation, this make Cyclic Group 100% true. So by this uniqueness, we can do all comparison separately.","title":"How to Make Fast Commutator"},{"location":"toward_science/Qubit%20Matrix%20Chain%20Multiplication%20in%20O%28n%29/","text":"Qubit Matrix Chain Multiplication in O(n) \u00b6 Benchmark Basics Current status Naive coding What I have done in SymPauli Relational data structure and super parallelism Chain multiplication Scalablility But comes with great penalty Conclusion Benchmark \u00b6 SymPauli \u00b6 https://github.com/hirasawakinko/SymPauli Basics \u00b6 Any Matrix can be expressed in sum of Pauli Operator.

Not because you don't have to, it is just because coefficient is not the main concern in this research.

For example OpenFermion. Some are not even usnig symbolic computation. Those are just expend string input into a matrix, and then carryout matrix vector multiplication. For example Qiskit, Qulacs.

I can do this under a second single-handedly, but them? Probably take more than 1 year to output the answer. For tensor product, you multiply stuffs bitwise-ly. As I*X -> X , the result is just matrix B itself. Cool? Naive coding \u00b6 So, what about OpenFermion's naive coding? Well, they almost got it but not quite. Say you are multipying two matrix A and B: Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 matrix A | matrix B = I Y | = X Z + Y X | + Y Y + X Y | + X Y + Z X | + Y Z | Just as what you will do to (x + 3)(x + 2) , you do the same thing to these matrix. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 first lable them... matrix A | matrix B = I Y | = X Z (b1) + Y X | + Y Y (b2) + X Y | + X Y (b3) + Z X | + Y Z | matrix A * matrix B = matrix A * b1 + matrix A * b2 + matrix A * b3 ... So you would carry the bitwise multiplication like this: Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 X Z (b1) Y Y (b2) X Y (b3) matrix A matrix A matrix A = I Y = I Y = I Y + Y X + + Y X + + Y X + X Y + X Y + X Y + Z X + Z X + Z X + Y Z + Y Z + Y Z Y Y (b2) X Y (b3) matrix A matrix A = I Y = I Y = something + + Y X + + Y X + X Y + X Y + Z X + Z X + Y Z + Y Z X Y (b3) matrix A = I Y = something + + Y X + X Y + Z X + Y Z At each step, you broadcase one row of matrix B to all rows of matrix A. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 matrix A = I Y * X Z (b1) + Y X * X Z (b1) + X Y * X Z (b1) + Z X * X Z (b1) + Y Z * X Z (b1) This approach seems legit, but absolutely we can do better and faster. What I have done in SymPauli \u00b6 As you can see in the precious section, we have to call out matrix A multiple times in order to carryout complete process of matrix multiplication. From this, we know that matrix A is basically not going to change anyway. Also the not-so-obvious one is that, Pauli Operator has its cyclic group property. It means that we can totally predict the outcome. When you merged like terms i.e. 2y + 3y +7x = 5y + 7x , there is only unique Pauli tensors left in the pool. Let say you have I X Y Z , still ignoring coefficient. Text Only 1 2 (I X Y Z) * X = (X I Z Y) (I +X +Y +Z) is the simpliest form of itself, you cannot simplify it anymore. After multiplying something, the outcome is still in its simpliest form. And you should notice that multiplication in here literally means permutation. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 (I X Y Z) * Y = (Y Z I X) (I X Y Z) * Z = (Z Y X I) Focus back on the matrix A * b1 : Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 X Z (b1) matrix A = I Y + Y X + X Y + Z X + Y Z Further focus on the left Pauli Operators: Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 X (b1) matrix A = I + Y + X + Z + Y By the previous rule, we know the answer already. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 (I X Y Z) * X = (X I Z Y) X (b1) matrix A = I -> X + Y -> Z + X -> I + Z -> Y + Y -> Z Here you see some duplication. i.e. we already know that X*Z -> Y , so why are we still checking it row by row? This is just a waste of time. Here it comes the relational data structure. Relational data structure and super parallelism \u00b6 This is one part of matrix A. And we are going to perform unified permutation operator to them all. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 matrix A = I * X + Y * X + X * X + Z * X + Y * X Here I purpose a relational data structure to execute a super parallelism algorithm. You have a fontend and a backend for this data structure. And you map every value of the fontend to the backend, so that its value refers to what it is at the back. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 front and back fontend backend I 0 = I Y 1 = X X 2 = Y Z 3 = Z Y mapping front to back fontend backend 0 0 = I 2 1 = X 1 2 = Y 3 3 = Z 2 When you do multiplication, we do it to the backend, not frontend. After that, you read out values of frontend from the backend. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 multiplying X fontend backend 0 0 = I 2 1 = X * X 1 2 = Y 3 3 = Z 2 multiplied X fontend backend 0 0 = X 2 1 = I 1 2 = Z 3 3 = Y 2 reading result fontend backend X < 0 0 = X Z < 2 1 = I I < 1 2 = Z Y < 3 3 = Y Z < 2 After reading out, you can reset matrix A to its init state solely by reseting the backend. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 reset backend fontend backend I < 0 0 = I Y < 2 1 = X X < 1 2 = Y Z < 3 3 = Z Y < 2 So it is back to original matrix A. So you can do the next multiplication (also because it requires the original one), namely: Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Y Y (b2) matrix A = I Y + Y X + X Y + Z X + Y Z Chain multiplication \u00b6 Last step in the last section we reset the backend. However it is not required if you are going to do a chain multiplication i.e. A * b * c * d * e * ... , {b c d e} are in small letter and they are one-row thing (not linear combination). Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 fontend backend I 0 = I Y 1 = X * b * c * d * e * ... X 2 = Y Z 3 = Z Y By not reseting the backend after every turn of multiplication, you are able to carry out the chain action that use precious state as the starting point of next action. So you can maintain the initial mapping and read the result with that initial mapping. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 initial mapping fontend backend 0 0 = I 2 1 = X * b * c * d * e * ... 1 2 = Y 3 3 = Z 2 after all multiplications fontend backend 0 0 = ? 2 1 = ? 1 2 = ? 3 3 = ? 2 you can read the result by the very same initial mapping fontend backend ? < 0 0 = ? ? < 2 1 = ? ? < 1 2 = ? ? < 3 3 = ? ? < 2 Scalablility \u00b6 This relational data structure and algorithm is parallel native. Even not under parallel programming, still be able to gain a masive speed up. Due to the fact that all data manipulation is done solely to the backend, and the backend is as small as a constant, i.e. size of backend array = 4 Pauli Operator * N qubits , complexity of O(n). With this size, you can easily pack that into CPU cache and do everything in unprecedented speed. This is the initial state of a 6 qubits backend, and you have one row of your matrix is (I I I I I I) : Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 qubits 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 = I 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 = X 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 = Y 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 = Z 3 3 3 3 3 3 my row : (I I I I I I) -> (0 0 0 0 0 0) For example multiplied by (X Y Z Y Z X) : Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 qubits 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 = I 1 2 3 2 3 1 1 = X 0 3 2 3 2 0 2 = Y 3 0 1 0 1 3 3 = Z 2 1 0 1 0 2 You just have to look at the same position of the table, to find out what it becomes now. Text Only 1 my row : (I I I I I I) -> (1 2 3 2 3 1) -> (X Y Z Y Z X) Same table applies to all rows. Multiply once, read many. Because Pauli Operator is Cyclic, Just like you rotate a analogue clock (those come with hours minutes pins), the internal relative position of 10 o'clock and 4 o'clock and others are not gonna to change. Second is that everything is summation, and the ordering of summation does not matter due to addition commutativity. So you can split the whole thing into subprocess and sum them up lately. Further is that tensor product of Pauli operator is carried out bitwise-ly, so that you can further split it into smaller subtasks. Also the small size of the backend makes the communicational cost very low. But comes with great penalty \u00b6 Read and write performance of this data structure is fatal. Since you have to first map the information of frontend to the backend, and after that you have to do the reverse. This kind of translation cost is super expensive, for matrix that is 30000 rows of Pauli tensor * 40 qubits , it is about 0.1X to 0.01X of the R/W performance. However, for the chain multiplication situation, R/W is only performed at first and the last, multiplying chain of 30000 rows of Pauli tensor * 40 qubits to the matrix of same size but in a linear combunation, this data structure is giving out 30000X to 40000X performance. Until now, I have been ignoring the coefficients, mainly focused on Pauli Operators. All comparison stated above is: Text Only 1 2 3 conventional with coefficient VS new without coefficient So yeah it is just BS benchmark and nothing you can take seriously. But that is because there is no room for improvement when we include coefficients into the calculation. At most 10X speend up at the same scale using Python, And I am already using Numpy for the heavy leafting coefficient work. So you can see that no coefficients, 40000X. Yes coefficients, 10X. Damn coefficients sucks. Conclusion \u00b6 I independently invented a new algorithm using relational data structure and phantomly revolutionized the contentional approach by 40000X under the same scale, but this is just when I ignore all computation work for the coefficients. With coefficients, 10X is the maximun I can get. So, long live the symbolic computation, god damn it numeric computation.","title":"Qubit Matrix Chain Multiplication in O(n)"},{"location":"toward_science/Qubit%20Matrix%20Chain%20Multiplication%20in%20O%28n%29/#qubit-matrix-chain-multiplication-in-on","text":"Benchmark Basics Current status Naive coding What I have done in SymPauli Relational data structure and super parallelism Chain multiplication Scalablility But comes with great penalty Conclusion","title":"Qubit Matrix Chain Multiplication in O(n)"},{"location":"toward_science/Qubit%20Matrix%20Chain%20Multiplication%20in%20O%28n%29/#benchmark","text":"","title":"Benchmark"},{"location":"toward_science/Qubit%20Matrix%20Chain%20Multiplication%20in%20O%28n%29/#sympauli","text":"https://github.com/hirasawakinko/SymPauli","title":"SymPauli"},{"location":"toward_science/Qubit%20Matrix%20Chain%20Multiplication%20in%20O%28n%29/#basics","text":"Any Matrix can be expressed in sum of Pauli Operator.

Matrix * Matrix How are these related to deep learning? Matrix Multiplication in Linear Algebra is probably the most spooky and mysterious mathematical function in the world. You can look it up in any textbooks, they suck, none of them really talk about how it works, why it works in that way, and why not the other ways. Turn out no one seems understand what exactly is happening in Matrix Multiplication? I heard you say \"no, you are wrong, I am one of the authors of that pile of books and I am sure I know my stuff\". Oh yeah? Prove my that. Oh you have already proved that. You wrote a book. And the content doesn't reflect that you understand Matrix at all. So here is me, after reading several of those insufferable textbooks, giving up understanding what really is a Matrix and its Multiplication. Then this idea comes up with my mind when I was reading a book about deep learning few days ago... Assuming \u00b6 I assume reader of this article has basic ideas about Vector, Matrix, Inner Product. Also I assume that reader do not understand the way that why Matrix multiply stuffs in that way. Text Only 1 2 3 [ 1 2 3 ] * [ x i t ] = [ 1x+2y+3z blah blah ] [ 4 5 6 ] [ y j u ] [ blah blah blah ] [ 7 8 9 ] [ z k v ] [ blah blah blah ] I assume that you are asking: ^What the ** does this means???? Motivation of Matrix * Vector \u00b6 Let say there exist some factors, represented as a vector Text Only 1 2 3 v = [v1] [v2] [v3] v is a vector, so I make it into a conventional column vector. v consist of 3 components of v1 v2 v3. And there are actions being token upon those values of v1 v2 v3. For example they represent wages of labers. The boss devided to increase everybody's wages by 100%. How are you going to computer that using vector? Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 new_v = 2 * [v1] [v2] [v3] = [2 v1] [2 v2] [2 v3] This is how you would do it. Multiple every component of the vector by a common scalar quantity. This sounds easy, but what about this. The boss now decided to increase everyone's wages by the total sum of 10% of their colleagues' wages. Now you cannot simply multiply a scalar quantity and call it a day. You need to look at other people's wages in order to determine the amount of increment. Rephase in the language of mathematical function: Before: Text Only 1 2 3 4 eq.1) new_v1 = 2 * v1 define this as function f as func_f . f is a function of variable v1. After: Text Only 1 2 3 4 eq.2) new_v1 = v1 + 0.1*v2 + 0.1*v3 define this as function g as func_g . g is a function of variables {v1, v2, v3} . Now that you see eq.2 got more variables on the right side of the equation, also indicate that it is a multi-variable function. new_v1 do not only rely on the value of old_v1, only rely on old value from v2 and v3. This sounds like non-STEM people talking about society issues. \"XX phenomenon is due to many factors thus it is complicated, so that we need more research into that blah blah blah\". Of couse you need more research. But speaking of research, we have already had the right tool for anlysing this kind of multi-factor multi-cause phenomenon. This tool is called Linear Algebra. So how can Linear Algebra solve this kind of multi-factor problem? You do a Matrix Multiplication. First consider just the case of v1. Namely, the process of old_v1 transfer to new_v1. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 new_v1 = [1 0.1 0.1] * [v1] [v2] [v3] = 1*v1 + 0.1*v2 + 0.1*v3 So this is a vector * vector situation. Or formally you may call it a \"inner product\" or a \"scalar product\". Looking at the right side of the equation, there is a row vector on the left and column vector on the right, you multiply them component-wise, and that add them together. The result will be a scaler quantity, not vector. This is how you produce the new value of v1. Through the inner product, now you are mixing up the values of all components. new_v1 have some portion of v2 and some portion of v3 in it. So this is a multi-factor stuff! And there is hidden parameter underneath this inner product. That is, components of all vectors are position-aware. You must not alter any of the position arbitrarily. Let say swaping 1 and 0.1 in the row vector for fun, and you will get the wrong answer. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 new_v1' = [0.1 1 0.1] * [v1] [v2] [v3] = 0.1*v1 + 1*v2 + 0.1*v3 It is because the position matters. The position means something even it is not written out. In particular, in the column vector, from top to the bottom, it contains the information of colleague no.1 to 3 respectively. And in the row vector, from left to right, it contains the information the coefficient you wanted to multiply toward colleague no.1 to 3's wages respectively. Text Only 1 2 3 [coef for v1, coef for v2, coef for v3] * [v1=wage of colleague 1] [v2=wage of colleague 2] [v3=wage of colleague 3] You can subsitute any real value you like, as long as you obey the idea of what meaning does that position represents. So this is the case for new_v1. What about new_v2 and new_v3? Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 new_v2 = [0.1 1 0.1] * [v1] [v2] [v3] = 0.1*v1 + 1*v2 + 0.1*v3 new_v3 = [0.1 0.1 1] * [v1] [v2] [v3] = 0.1*v1 + 0.1*v2 + 1*v3 You can see that they are structually the same accross v1 v2 v3. They are all inner product. Now, we are producting the new wage one-by-one, which seems inefficient. Is there a way to do all for once? Yes. That is the Matrix * Vector. Before going into Matrix * Vector, there is a key idea that must be recap. That is, components in the column vector is position-aware and you can not change that afterwards. Namely: Text Only 1 2 3 [v1=wage of colleague 1] [v2=wage of colleague 2] [v3=wage of colleague 3] Thus after computing their new wages, the position excusively for one person is still reserved for that same person. Text Only 1 2 3 [old_v1] -> [new_v1] [old_v2] -> [new_v2] [old_v3] -> [new_v3] Column vector is still column vector, and that position is still representing the particular person's wage. In one word, the column vector must maintain the exact same structure after Matrix * Vector. To be clear: This is what we have already know. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 new_v1 = [1 0.1 0.1] * [v1] [v2] [v3] = 1*v1 + 0.1*v2 + 0.1*v3 = new_v1 new_v2 = [0.1 1 0.1] * [v1] [v2] [v3] = 0.1*v1 + 1*v2 + 0.1*v3 = new_v2 new_v3 = [0.1 0.1 1] * [v1] [v2] [v3] = 0.1*v1 + 0.1*v2 + 1*v3 = new_v2 And they should be in this structure. Text Only 1 2 3 [new_v1] [new_v2] [new_v3] You may have already see this coming. You just combine them structurely. Text Only 1 2 3 [ 1 0.1 0.1] * [v1] = [new_v1] [0.1 1 0.1] [v2] [new_v2] [0.1 0.1 1 ] [v3] [new_v3] To make it visually making more sense, I should write it in this way. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 multiply their values to everyone in the same column > [ v1 v2 v3] this row outputs new_v1 > [ 1 0.1 0.1] = [new_v1] this row outputs new_v2 > [0.1 1 0.1] [new_v2] this row outputs new_v3 > [0.1 0.1 1 ] [new_v3] This answers two questions at the same time. Why is that multiplying a matrix need to do row-column, row-column kind of stuff (as what conventional textbooks told you to do) ? It is to maintain the structure of the input vector. Meanwhile, still has to make sure the output is a linear combination of the old ones ( namely new_v1 = a*v1 + b*v2 + c*v3 ) . So that you are able to deal with the \"many things are inter-related to each other\" hard problem. Non square matrix? \u00b6 But there also exist non square matrix in the world, as the only matrix presented in the previous section is merely a square matrix. How can I make sense to any of those non square matrix? Recap the last picture in the previous section. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 multiply their values to everyone in the same column > [ v1 v2 v3] this row outputs new_v1 > [ 1 0.1 0.1] = [new_v1] this row outputs new_v2 > [0.1 1 0.1] [new_v2] this row outputs new_v3 > [0.1 0.1 1 ] [new_v3] Previously, we are considering the positional meaning of the output vector is the same as the input vector. They still representing wages of someone. What if now it does not anymore. Say, now these 3 colleagues's wages are affecting other stuffs. For example they will spend their money on their weekend, and there are many local stores in the shopping mall. Somehow you get to know how exactly they are going to spend on those stores. Thus you can have this new matrix multiplication. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 multiply their values to everyone in the same column > [ v1 v2 v3] this row outputs shop1_sales > [ 1 0 3 ] = [shop1_sales] this row outputs shop2_sales > [ 0 2 0 ] [shop2_sales] this row outputs shop3_sales > [ 3 0 4 ] [shop3_sales] this row outputs shop4_sales > [ 2 1 2 ] [shop4_sales] this row outputs shop5_sales > [ 1 5 0 ] [shop5_sales] [ 1 0 3 ] * [v1] = [shop1_sales] [ 0 2 0 ] [v2] [shop2_sales] [ 3 0 4 ] [v3] [shop3_sales] [ 2 1 2 ] [shop4_sales] [ 1 5 0 ] [shop5_sales] By such non square Matrix Multiplication, not only you have changed the size of the vector outcome, you also changed what those components in the vector are standing for. And these changes are intended and information of what stands for what is embeded in the Matrix you choose to multiply. Does this make sense? Matrix * Matrix \u00b6 So, as the boss increase their wages, they can spend more to buy things. And they are not going to change their shopping behavior at all. And you want to see what is the different between now and then. You can do this, Matrix * Matrix . Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 [ 1 0 3 ] * [v1 new_v1] = [shop1_sales new_shop1_sales] [ 0 2 0 ] [v2 new_v2] [shop2_sales new_shop2_sales] [ 3 0 4 ] [v3 new_v1] [shop3_sales new_shop3_sales] [ 2 1 2 ] [shop4_sales new_shop4_sales] [ 1 5 0 ] [shop5_sales new_shop5_sales] Or this can be, somehow there is another team of colleagues consist of 3 people (w1 w2 w3), also they shop on the same shopping mall in the weekend and the way they spend their money is totally the same as those 3 people back there. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 [ 1 0 3 ] * [v1 w1] = [shop1_sales_by_v new_shop1_sales_by_w] [ 0 2 0 ] [v2 w2] [shop2_sales_by_v new_shop2_sales_by_w] [ 3 0 4 ] [v3 w3] [shop3_sales_by_v new_shop3_sales_by_w] [ 2 1 2 ] [shop4_sales_by_v new_shop4_sales_by_w] [ 1 5 0 ] [shop5_sales_by_v new_shop5_sales_by_w] How are these related to deep learning? \u00b6 As I explained in this article, using matrix multiplication help you solve that \"many things are inter-related to each other\" problem, this is why machine learning use Linear Algebra as its backbone. For example there is a picture. You are going to write a program to determin what is in the picture. There may be a person in the picture, or maybe a dog, or a cat, or a flower. But this task is not easy at all per the programming point of view. There may be hair-like stuff in the picture but that doesn't automatically lead to the conclusion that there is a dog inside the picture. A dog is more that hairs. Maybe paws + hairs + big eyes + more can satisfy most of the features of a dog. But writing such program to capture all the features of a dog is overwhelmingly complex. What should you do? Matrix multiplication. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Matrix * [pixel1] = [feature1] [pixel2] [feature2] [pixel3] [feature3] . [feature4] . [feature5] . [feature6] . . . After gone through all the previous sections you should be able to see how this works. Otherwise just inform me that my explaination sucks. I will try improve it and edit it if you request. So ultimately you want to extract whether there is this feature or that feature from the original picture. You multiply the vector consitute of information of the original picture by the specific matrix. So that for example the feature1, will be a linear combination of all the pixels. Text Only 1 feature1 = a*pixel1 + b*pixel2 + c*pixel3 + ... For instance, if feature49 requires that pixel1, 3, 26 are filled with color at the same time, and everything else are leave blank: Text Only 1 feature49 = +a*pixel1 -b*picel2 +c*pixel3 -d*pixel4 -... + z*pixel26 Every pixel that is not in {1,3,26} contribute nagetively to the value of feature49. Only when pixels in {1,3,26} are filled with colors and not the others satisfy the existence of feature49, otherwise the picture do not have feature49. So you extracted the basic features from picture. There is more you can do. What about combination of basic features. For example a more complex feature that requires feature1 and feature2 's co-existence. Like recognizing hairs and paws. The next step is to recogize that \"having hairs and having paws at the same time\" is important than either one of those. So there is another matrix multiplication for this. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Matrix2 * [feature1] = [complex_feature1] [feature2] [complex_feature2] [feature3] [complex_feature3] [feature4] [complex_feature4] [feature5] [complex_feature5] [feature6] [complex_feature6] . [complex_feature7] . [complex_feature8] . . . . And you can do this again and again and agin... finally you have a row vactor that decides which super complex feature indicates that it is highly likely to have a dog inside a picture. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Row Vector * [super_complex_feature1] = (a scalar. zero or one. yes or no.) [super_complex_feature2] [super_complex_feature3] [super_complex_feature4] [super_complex_feature5] [super_complex_feature6] . . . Now deep learning make sense too, after understanding what is happening in Matrix Multiplication. And also it is not hard to understand that solving problems through Linear Algebra can handle way more complex problems then any methods by non-STEM scholars. You sure can have absurbly larger matrix to represent every single distinct feature of everything to study how they are inter-related to each other. But what I have seen in the non-STEM field? Ploting a 3 dimensional graph is maxium. All they can imagine is up to 3 features. Hairs and paws and big-eyes and 4-legs for a dog? That counts to 4 and it is way to complicated for human to understand. \"You can never understand a dog through numbers\" is what they will say. But I disagree.","title":"So What Exactly is happenig in Matrix Multiplication?"},{"location":"toward_science/So%20What%20Exactly%20is%20happenig%20in%20Matrix%20Multiplication/#so-what-exactly-is-happenig-in-matrix-multiplication","text":"Assuming Motivation of Matrix * Vector Non square matrix?

Text Only 1 2 3 [coef for v1, coef for v2, coef for v3] * [v1=wage of colleague 1] [v2=wage of colleague 2] [v3=wage of colleague 3] You can subsitute any real value you like, as long as you obey the idea of what meaning does that position represents. So this is the case for new_v1. What about new_v2 and new_v3? Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 new_v2 = [0.1 1 0.1] * [v1] [v2] [v3] = 0.1*v1 + 1*v2 + 0.1*v3 new_v3 = [0.1 0.1 1] * [v1] [v2] [v3] = 0.1*v1 + 0.1*v2 + 1*v3 You can see that they are structually the same accross v1 v2 v3. They are all inner product. Now, we are producting the new wage one-by-one, which seems inefficient. Is there a way to do all for once? Yes. That is the Matrix * Vector. Before going into Matrix * Vector, there is a key idea that must be recap. That is, components in the column vector is position-aware and you can not change that afterwards. Namely: Text Only 1 2 3 [v1=wage of colleague 1] [v2=wage of colleague 2] [v3=wage of colleague 3] Thus after computing their new wages, the position excusively for one person is still reserved for that same person. Text Only 1 2 3 [old_v1] -> [new_v1] [old_v2] -> [new_v2] [old_v3] -> [new_v3] Column vector is still column vector, and that position is still representing the particular person's wage. In one word, the column vector must maintain the exact same structure after Matrix * Vector. To be clear: This is what we have already know. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 new_v1 = [1 0.1 0.1] * [v1] [v2] [v3] = 1*v1 + 0.1*v2 + 0.1*v3 = new_v1 new_v2 = [0.1 1 0.1] * [v1] [v2] [v3] = 0.1*v1 + 1*v2 + 0.1*v3 = new_v2 new_v3 = [0.1 0.1 1] * [v1] [v2] [v3] = 0.1*v1 + 0.1*v2 + 1*v3 = new_v2 And they should be in this structure. Text Only 1 2 3 [new_v1] [new_v2] [new_v3] You may have already see this coming. You just combine them structurely. Text Only 1 2 3 [ 1 0.1 0.1] * [v1] = [new_v1] [0.1 1 0.1] [v2] [new_v2] [0.1 0.1 1 ] [v3] [new_v3] To make it visually making more sense, I should write it in this way.

Why is that multiplying a matrix need to do row-column, row-column kind of stuff (as what conventional textbooks told you to do) ? It is to maintain the structure of the input vector. Meanwhile, still has to make sure the output is a linear combination of the old ones ( namely new_v1 = a*v1 + b*v2 + c*v3 ) .

For example there is a picture. You are going to write a program to determin what is in the picture. There may be a person in the picture, or maybe a dog, or a cat, or a flower. But this task is not easy at all per the programming point of view. There may be hair-like stuff in the picture but that doesn't automatically lead to the conclusion that there is a dog inside the picture. A dog is more that hairs. Maybe paws + hairs + big eyes + more can satisfy most of the features of a dog. But writing such program to capture all the features of a dog is overwhelmingly complex. What should you do? Matrix multiplication. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Matrix * [pixel1] = [feature1] [pixel2] [feature2] [pixel3] [feature3] . [feature4] . [feature5] . [feature6] . . . After gone through all the previous sections you should be able to see how this works. Otherwise just inform me that my explaination sucks. I will try improve it and edit it if you request. So ultimately you want to extract whether there is this feature or that feature from the original picture. You multiply the vector consitute of information of the original picture by the specific matrix. So that for example the feature1, will be a linear combination of all the pixels. Text Only 1 feature1 = a*pixel1 + b*pixel2 + c*pixel3 + ... For instance, if feature49 requires that pixel1, 3, 26 are filled with color at the same time, and everything else are leave blank: Text Only 1 feature49 = +a*pixel1 -b*picel2 +c*pixel3 -d*pixel4 -... + z*pixel26 Every pixel that is not in {1,3,26} contribute nagetively to the value of feature49. Only when pixels in {1,3,26} are filled with colors and not the others satisfy the existence of feature49, otherwise the picture do not have feature49. So you extracted the basic features from picture. There is more you can do. What about combination of basic features. For example a more complex feature that requires feature1 and feature2 's co-existence. Like recognizing hairs and paws. The next step is to recogize that \"having hairs and having paws at the same time\" is important than either one of those. So there is another matrix multiplication for this. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Matrix2 * [feature1] = [complex_feature1] [feature2] [complex_feature2] [feature3] [complex_feature3] [feature4] [complex_feature4] [feature5] [complex_feature5] [feature6] [complex_feature6] . [complex_feature7] . [complex_feature8] . . . .

Now deep learning make sense too, after understanding what is happening in Matrix Multiplication.

You sure can have absurbly larger matrix to represent every single distinct feature of everything to study how they are inter-related to each other. But what I have seen in the non-STEM field? Ploting a 3 dimensional graph is maxium. All they can imagine is up to 3 features. Hairs and paws and big-eyes and 4-legs for a dog? That counts to 4 and it is way to complicated for human to understand. \"You can never understand a dog through numbers\" is what they will say.

People have been wasting time on their shit code to do this arithematic straightly. Here I propose the new algorithm. Premise \u00b6 Premise: Pauli Operator \u00b6 Pauli Operator is a set of 2x2 matrix denoted by symbols of {I, X, Y, Z}. They are matrix, so they obey every law of linear algebra. They are the core part of Quantum Computing. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 I = [ 1 0] [ 0 1] X = [ 0 1] [ 1 0] Y = [ 0 -j] [ j 0] Z = [ 1 0] [ 0 -1] Premise: Dictionary for Pauli Operator multiplication \u00b6 First of all, we need a dictionary to check what is what, when two Pauli multiplied together, what will be the result. And since matrix multiplication is binary operation, the dictionary key consist of two consecutive Pauli Operator symbols. I choose the approach that seperate Pauli Operator and its coefficient to reduce total count of loops in the program. Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 # Seperating Pauli Operator and its coefficient lookup_xyz = { 'XY' : 'Z' , 'YX' : 'Z' , 'XZ' : 'Y' , 'ZX' : 'Y' , 'YZ' : 'X' , 'ZY' : 'X' } lookup_cof = { 'XY' : 1 j , 'YX' : - 1 j , 'XZ' : - 1 j , 'ZX' : 1 j , 'YZ' : 1 j , 'ZY' : - 1 j } But if you choose the compounded approach, you would need to call out element[0], element[1] which is a waste of time. Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # Compounded Pauli Operator and its coefficient lookup = { 'XY' : ( 'Z' , 1 j ), 'YX' : ( 'Z' , - 1 j ), 'XZ' : ( 'Y' , - 1 j ), 'ZX' : ( 'Y' , 1 j ), 'YZ' : ( 'X' , 1 j ), 'ZY' : ( 'X' , - 1 j ) } Premise: Terms in linear combination must be unique \u00b6 By the way, this is all established in the premise of well defined dataset. Namely, all terms inside the linear combination are unique. For example let say we have a linear combination of two Z1 (see below). It will automatically merge them into one. Text Only 1 2 QubitOperator('''1 [Z1] + 1 [Z1]''') = 2 [Z1] I want the merged version. Otherwise my algorithm do not work. Premise: comm(A, B) as the symbol of commutator \u00b6 The convention for mathematical symbol of commutator is [A, B]. Which stand for the arithematic operation of (AB - BA). I must not use this anywhere in my article because this symbolically collides with Python code and bring unnecessary confusion textually. Instead, I use comm(A, B) to represent the comumutator operation. Singular Commutativity \u00b6 Single means only one term in the linear combination. Let's first deal with the most specific one, i.e. comm(single, single). Say we have two Pauli Operator a and b. We need to check if they are commute to each other.

How to multiply Pauli Operator? Multiplication of Pauli Operator \u00b6 First thing to know is that either a and b is tensor product of Pauli Operators with coefficient. Text Only 1 2 3 [coefficient] [tensor product of Pauli Operators] a) +1.0 Y0 X1 X2 Y3 b) +1.0 Z1 X3 The neat thing about tensor product is that the outcome is in fact index sensitive.

Text Only 1 2 Z1 X3 == Z1 X3 # nothing happen since index differ Z1 X1 == ZX1 = (Y1, 1j) # Outcome is Y1 with coefficient 1j, according to the dictionary And the coefficient can be any usually number.

Those outfo Pauli XYZ can in fact be ignored since we are 100% sure that they are the same thing. And we are looking at things that are potentially will be changed after arithematic i.e. [focus] part. I will prove this in the section of Uniqueness of Pauli XYZ .

Text Only 1 2 3 XY == YX == Z ZZ == ZZ == I YI == IY == Y Hence we can bascially assume that the multiplication outcome for Pauli XYZ is always the same. 100% sure. Not even bother to check. So we can ignore one more thing: Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 For example in such situation (+1.0 XZ1 YX3) - (+1.0 ZX1 XY3) In index 1 and index 3, we don't ask if the Pauli XYZ outcome of left part of the minus sign is the same accross the right part. They must automatically the same. Predicting coefficient \u00b6 Here we multiply coefficient of both sides of the minus sign one by one. This could be computational intense when we have a lot to do. Is there a way to know the final result directly? Yes there is one. Just look at the dictionary and you can see that the ordering only make result differ by the sign.

Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 = comm( -1.0 , +1.0 Z1 X3 ) +comm( +1.0 X0 Y1 Y2 X3 , +1.0 Z1 X3 ) +comm( +1.0 Y0 X1 X2 Y3 , +1.0 Z1 X3 ) +comm( -1.0 X0 X1 Y2 Y3 , +1.0 Z1 X3 ) +comm( -1.0 Y0 Y1 X2 X3 , +1.0 Z1 X3 ) +comm( +1.0 Z0 , +1.0 Z1 X3 ) +comm( +1.0 Z0 Z1 , +1.0 Z1 X3 ) +comm( +1.0 Z0 Z2 , +1.0 Z1 X3 ) +comm( +1.0 Z0 Z3 , +1.0 Z1 X3 ) +comm( +1.0 Z1 , +1.0 Z1 X3 ) +comm( +1.0 Z1 Z2 , +1.0 Z1 X3 ) +comm( +1.0 Z1 Z3 , +1.0 Z1 X3 ) +comm( -1.0 Z2 , +1.0 Z1 X3 ) +comm( +1.0 Z2 Z3 , +1.0 Z1 X3 ) +comm( -1.0 Z3 , +1.0 Z1 X3 ) Now we can deal with each of these seperately instead of thinking how to deal with all terms simultaneously. I call each term of AA as 'a', likewise each term of B as 'b'. Obviously there is only 1 'b' in this case, so 'b' stand for 1.0 [Z1 X3]. Look at the first term, Text Only 1 0) comm( -1.0 , +1.0 Z1 X3 ) There is no Pauli XYZ inside A. Why? It is actually a convention in most of the symbolic computation library that always ommiting the Pauli I Operator. Because you will always get the same thing when multiplying Pauli I to any Pauli XYZ. Hence, comm(a0, b) is no doubt commute. Text Only 1 a0b - ba0 == 0 # by the fact that a0 is Pauli I But for any terms that contain things other than Pauli I, you need to check wether it is commute. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 1) comm( +1.0 X0 Y1 Y2 X3 , +1.0 Z1 X3 ) = comm( +1.0 X0 Y1 Y2 X3, +1.0 Z1 X3) = comm( +1.0 Y1 X3 , +1.0 Z1 X3 ) # focus on common index = YZ XX - ZY XX # lets use the clockwiseness techinque from previous section ## we can solely keep track of the first (left) clockwiseness Anticlockwise%2 ^ Clockwise%2 = 1 ^ 0 = 1 = non commute One counter example is enough, so comm(AA, B) return False immediately. Uniqueness of Pauli XYZ \u00b6 The most important notion about Pauli XYZ is that it form a cyclic group and thus maintain uniqueness. This uniqueness ensure that we can boradcase like above paragraph and reject commutativity immediately after one counter example found. Otherwise we must check for all pattern to see whether they are commute or not. What if there did not exist uniquess? Let say we got comm(AA, B). And currently comparing AA[i] and B[0]. Text Only 1 comm( AA[i] , B[0] ) When they commute, they cancel out. But when they NOT commute, the remainder stay. What will then happen? Remember that we are comparing AA and B. We scan from AA[0] to AA[n]. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 If comm(AA[1], BB[0]) != 0 Since we multiplied AA[1] by BB[0], this should form a new term that we don't know yet comm(AA[1], B[0]) => something else let say 1 * R_1 Then we meet other commute pair Let say comm(AA[2], B[0]) == 0 But this is just meaning that comm(AA[2], B[0]) => something else let say 1 * R_2 What if there is another R_2 ? What if R_1 is actually R_2 ? So we cannot cancel out the Pauli Tensor from comm(AA[2], B[0]), although comm(AA[2], B[0]) == 0 If this kind of thing can be happened, then we must check for all terms to make sure the final remainder is zero, then finally we can say AA and B is commute But we don't need to do that. Let me prove it. Since Pauli XYZ is a cyclic group. Text Only 1 2 X Z Y Let say you got Y, multiplying X to results Z. You can do the same thing on the above triangle. Try draw a line from Y, passing X, you must reach Z. Then you have a set of Pauli XYZ. Just think of many of those triangles all happening at once. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 B [focus] B0 ... AA [focus] [outfo] AA0 ... ... AA1 ... ... AA2 ... ... Recall the section of Premise: terms in linear combination must be unique . Each Pauli XYZ inside AA is a unique permutation of Pauli Tensor. For the outfo part, just assume that they are all having the same exactly one permutation. Even that, the focus part must all differ from each other within same set i.e. within AA. Let say AA consist of 3 rows and they differ from each other in only one Pauli XYZ. And B[0] is Z Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 B [focus] 0 Z AA [focus] [outfo] 0 X ... 1 Y ... 2 Z ... = AAB [focus] [outfo] 0 XZ ... 1 YZ ... 2 ZZ ... = AAB [focus] [outfo] 0 Y ... 1 X ... 2 I ... Terms in AA are still differ from each other after multiplication. Because they are all multiplied by the same thing. Their relative distance after being multiplied still remain unchanged. Think of that XYZ triangle analogy. You got 3 of them now. And then you rotate them simultaneously by same unit. Their relative status do not change after all. Like you multiply 3 to [1. 2. 3], they change to [3, 6, 9] and they still differ internally before and after. Hence uniqueness of Pauli XYZ is ensured and we can safely do the broadcasting and cancel out comm(AA[i], B[0]) = 0 terms.

Is that difficult? Yes it is not an easy job to think about it. But don't worry, because I solved it for you already. Cartesian Product \u00b6 To do comm(AA, BB), we need to broadcase everything in BB to everything in AA. And this is simplily the case of Cartesian Product. You can write some simple code to see what it is. Python 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 from itertools import product AA = [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ] BB = [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ] for a , b in product ( AA , BB ): print ( a , b ) # 0 0 # 0 1 # 0 2 # 0 3 # 1 0 # 1 1 # ... So if we are to check whether AA and BB commute, we have to check for all combination in the worst case. This can be super computational intense if you do this straight. And some guy do carry the whole calculation of AABB - BBAA, namely, carry out the multiplication of AABB and BBAA seperately then subtract them. This is just a waste of time since we have already discovered everything from the symmetry of Pauli XYZ and being able to ignore so many maniplulations and still obtain the result. Just note that you can see that from the Cartesian Product, 01 and 10, or things like this can be happened. The mirror image of the same thing. The number is originally denoted as the index of AA and BB. But what if, what if those {0,1,2,3,...} stands for some unique Pauli XYZ sequence? We can see that this may indicate a exact concern among the symmetry. Degerenate uniqueness \u00b6 Last section I proved the uniquness of Pauli XYZ within a linear combination. This however, do not work in the general case which is comm(many, many) i.e. comm(AA, BB). Things are unique inside AA. Things also unique inside BB. But the point is the same thing can be possessed by AA and BB at the same time. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 [AA] [BB] 0 ... ... 1 ... ... 2 Z0 X1 X2 ... 3 ... ... 4 ... Z0 X1 X2 5 ...

So, a pair of couple 0 and 1. Just differed by the ordering. But what are they actually? Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 since comm(a, b) = ab - ba0 comm(0, 1) = 01 - 10 comm(1, 0) = 10 - 01 = -(01 - 10) # Oops sum it ! comm(0, 1) + comm(1, 0) = (01 - 10) + -(01 - 10) = 0 # This commute, but if and only if the coefficient of left0 and right0 is the exactly same thing if not, it will be like 0.5*(01 - 10) + -0.3*(01 - 10) = 0.2*(01 - 10) => NON commute So they added up. This is not happened in the previous section in Special Commutativity. In fact this kind of order-reverted commutativity is well known. From this result, we can see that if the exactly same pair is pocessesed by both AA and BB, then we automatically know this pair commute.

You have to check for their clockwiseness. And since the uniqueness is degenerated in general case, we cannot return False just because one pair is non commute.

Sometimes people want the remainder more than commutativity. And I got you. So, we have been avoid calculating the coefficient of NON commute outcome. Because, from the textbook or from the first section, people knew that there is only two result from NON commute prduct. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Clockwise => 1j Anticlockwise => -1j XY - YX = Clockwise - Anticlockwise = 1j - (-1j) = 2j ZY - YZ = Anticlockwise - Clockwise = -1j - 1j = -2j This is simple, because we only do this on one single Pauli XYZ, that is why they only post this on textbook. What happen if we got a Tensor Product of Pauli XYZ? Text Only 1 2 Clockwise * Clockwise * Anticlockwise * Anticlockwise ... => ? Anticlockwise * Anticlockwise * Clockwise * Clockwise ... => -?

Just call Clockwise 'clw' and Anticlockwise 'aclw'. Text Only 1 (ca * cb) * [(-1)**(aclw) * (1j)**(clw + aclw) - (-1)**(clw) * (1j)**(clw + aclw)] The problem is the big thing behind (ca * cb) . Its value depends on count of clw and aclw. Text Only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 (-1)**(aclw) * (1j)**(clw + aclw) - (-1)**(clw) * (1j)**(clw + aclw) = (1j)**(clw + aclw) * [(-1)**(aclw) - (-1)**(clw)] => eq.0 Commute means that coefficient equals zero. this can happen if and only if the right part equal zero 0 = (1j)**(clw + aclw) * [(-1)**(aclw) - (-1)**(clw)] => [(-1)**(aclw) - (-1)**(clw)] == zero This is just adding and subtracting, it can be zero But what is exponential of -1 ? (-1)**0 = 1 (-1)**1 = -1 (-1)**2 = 1 (-1)**3 = -1 (-1)**4 = 1 ... we can just count the parity clw and aclw for this part But what is then (1j)**(clw + aclw) ? 1j** 0 = 1 1j** 1 = 1j 1j** 2 = -1 1j** 3 = -1j 1j** 4 = 1 1j** 5 = 1j ... There is -1 inside ! The left part is entangled with the right part !!!!! This is complicated. -1 and j are not independent from each other. This cannot be solved trivially. We have two data, namely, number of clockwise and anticlock. Let see what we can do with them.

Why not try 0-1 or 1-0? 0 - 1 == -1 So (aclw%2 - clw%2) is the answer for the sign we successfully connect the parity of clw and aclw to negative sign And 1j exponential has a cycle of 4, so the value of 1j part depend on (clw + aclw)%4 or (clw%4 + aclw%4) or (clw%4 + aclw%4)%4 But clw and aclw cannot have same parity, otherwise they are comute and cancel out. No even+even or odd+odd Only even+odd => odd clw + aclw can only be 1 and 3 1j** 1 = 1j 1j** 3 = -1j So this is a math question of, what number satisfy the following two equation eq.1 aclw%2 - clw%2 == 1 or -1 eq.2 (clw%4 + aclw%4) == 1 or 3 Summing eq.1 and eq.2 will get this eq.1.+eq.2 (aclw%2-clw%2) + (clw%4+aclw%4) == ? Recall that {1,-1} from eq.1 is the indicator for { 2,-2 } and {1, 3} from eq.2 is the indicator for {1j,-1j} We can do carry out the calculation of the original eq.0 and eq.1 eq.2 to see there is indeed a isomorphism between these equations [eq.1] [eq.2] [result] [eq.0L] [eq.0R] [result] SUM /----> (2) MULTIPLY /----> (-2j) / / (-1)-----(1)----> (0) (2)-----(j)----> (2j) \\ / \\ / \\/ \\/ /\\ /\\ / \\ / \\ (1)-----(3)----> (4) (-2)----(-j)----> (2j) \\ \\ \\----> (2) \\----> (-2j) So {0,4} from eq.1.+eq.2 maps to ( 2j) { 2} from eq.1.+eq.2 maps to (-2j) In fact 4 == 0 (mod 4), so for a module4 system {0} from eq.1.+eq.2 maps to ( 2j) {2} from eq.1.+eq.2 maps to (-2j) Hence we know that coefficient == 2j iff (eq.1.+eq.2)%4 == 0 == -2j iff (eq.1.+eq.2)%4 == 2 _______________________________________________________________________________________________ | clw aclw original equation a=clw%2-aclw%2 b=(clw%4+aclw%4)%4 (a+b)%4 finalresult | |______________________________________________________________________________________________| | 0 1 -2 * 1j 1 1 2 (-0-2j) | | 0 3 -2 * (-0-1j) 1 3 0 2j | | 1 0 2 * 1j -1 1 0 2j | | 1 2 2 * (-0-1j) -1 3 2 -2j | | 2 1 -2 * (-0-1j) 1 3 0 2j | | 2 3 -2 * 1j 1 1 2 (-0-2j) | | 3 0 2 * (-0-1j) -1 3 2 -2j | | 3 2 2 * 1j -1 1 0 2j | |______________________________________________________________________________________________| ((aclw%2 - clw%2) + (clw%4 + aclw%4)%4)%4 = {(2, -2j), (0, 2j)} since -1 has order of cycle == 2, and 1j has order of cycle ==4, check until n=4 is enough for revealing all pattern. Now can now use this magic equation to answer the question. Instead of multiplying the long sequencence of 1j and -1j, we count the number of clockwise and anticlockwise, then we know everything. Since {2j, -2j} is the only set of result, we can factorize 2j and multiply it back at the end of the function. Reduce Complexity \u00b6 That is just some fansy technique to eliminate multiplication and replace it with addition and other primitive arithematics. But 1 year after I finished this script, I found that there is alternative simplier method. First notion is that mulitiplication of imaginary number is a C4 cyclic group. j is clockwise movement, -j is anticlockwise movement. Take the always positive module 4 of (-j)**n, it becomes clockwise. Text Only 1 (-j)**n = j**((-n)%4) So, there we can encompass both (j) (-j) under one variable. Text Only 1 2 3 (j)**m * (-j)**n = (j)**(m%4) * j**((-n)%4) = (j)**((m-n)%4) And in AB - BA, we need the clockwiseness of AB is different that BA. The final clockwiseness is now reduced to (clw-aclw)%4. We do not need (clw-aclw)%4 in {0,2} since if you swap clw and aclw, the result is the same, means that AB==BA. So what left is {1,3}.

Terms in AA are still differ from each other after multiplication. Because they are all multiplied by the same thing. Their relative distance after being multiplied still remain unchanged. Think of that XYZ triangle analogy. You got 3 of them now. And then you rotate them simultaneously by same unit. Their relative status do not change after all. Like you multiply 3 to [1. 2. 3], they change to [3, 6, 9] and they still differ internally before and after. Hence uniqueness of Pauli XYZ is ensured and we can safely do the broadcasting and cancel out comm(AA[i], B[0]) = 0 terms.","title":"Uniqueness of Pauli XYZ"},{"location":"toward_science/Special%20and%20General%20Commutativity%20of%20Pauli%20Operator/#code_1","text":"commutator_special 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 def commutator_special ( AA , B ): # Only clockwiseness dictionary is needed lookup = { 'XY' : 0 , 'YX' : 1 , 'XZ' : 1 , 'ZX' : 0 , 'YZ' : 0 , 'ZY' : 1 } # Hash the whole AA dict for faster checking AA_Hashs = { hash (( key , val )): ( dict ( key ), val ) for key , val in AA . items () } for b_key , b_cof in B . keys : # This loop has only one element b_key = dict ( b_key ) if hash ( b_key ) in AA_Hashs : # Self commute return True # Only dict.values is enough.
